<v Jane Smythe>You said you've invested many, many, many years ago.</v>

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Jane Smythe>Nothing.</v>

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Jane Smythe>You've got nothing at the minute and identify areas of needs to discuss.</v>

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Jane Smythe>So we're gonna go through a full financial review, which means I'll look at all your areas.</v>

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Jane Smythe>Sure.</v>

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Jane Smythe>So look at pension.</v>

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Jane Smythe>I know you're retired, but look at pensions.</v>

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.860

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Jane Smythe>Yes.</v>

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Jane Smythe>Agree.</v>

<v Jane Smythe>Next steps and book a second meeting.</v>

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Jane Smythe>OK with that.</v>

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.240
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, fine.</v>

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Jane Smythe>Thank you.</v>

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Jane Smythe>Can I just ask a quick question? How old are you? Sorry,</v>

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Charlie Green>I'm 63.</v>

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Charlie Green>That's it.</v>

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Jane Smythe>I'm throwing things around now.</v>

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Charlie Green>Good job.</v>

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Jane Smythe>Yes.</v>

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Jane Smythe>So realistically, the reason you've come to see me is because you've moved from London to here because, like you just explained to me, your daughter moved, you were babysitting.</v>

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Jane Smythe>It was just you fell in love with and you got surplus funds sitting in your account.</v>

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Jane Smythe>I do.</v>

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Jane Smythe>And you want to look for a home for some of that money.</v>

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.020
<v Jane Smythe>That's why you're here.</v>

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Jane Smythe>HM</v>

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.940
<v Jane Smythe>you've</v>

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Jane Smythe>got enough income coming in.</v>

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.580
<v Jane Smythe>You just want growth for this money.</v>

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Jane Smythe>You divorce, which was about 30 years ago.</v>

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Jane Smythe>So you're single and what you're looking for, the objective is to get.</v>

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Jane Smythe>Actually returns and try and sort of keep up with inflation.</v>

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Jane Smythe>Not really any specific term or amount, it's just you want to keep up with inflation.</v>

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.300
<v Jane Smythe>You do have 10,000 we need to keep aside, which I won't take you to the equation for a car that you may think about buying HM.</v>

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Jane Smythe>You don't pay into a pension and you've potentially make, well, you will get a state pension in four years time, so you can draw on your private pension, don't you?</v>

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.600
<v Charlie Green>Got my income at the moment is this is part private pension.</v>

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Jane Smythe>I think you'll find the standard of living will be better than it was in London.</v>

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Jane Smythe>I guess with you pension you probably get</v>

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.520
<v Charlie Green>I I'm waiting to sort of get.</v>

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.220
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, find out.</v>

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Jane Smythe>I think that probably would help, wouldn't it? Yeah.</v>

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.370
<v Jane Smythe>Nobody</v>

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.110
<v Jane Smythe>financially dependent on you.</v>

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Jane Smythe>You're not dependent on anybody and no health issues that would have an impact.</v>

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Charlie Green>Correct.</v>

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.030
<v Charlie Green>I think the only thing that I was gonna add to that was I think I mentioned I wanted to put a bit of an amount of money my my granddaughters name</v>

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Jane Smythe>as well transfer that.</v>

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.510
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Jane Smythe>So I'll keep that.</v>

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Jane Smythe>Obviously I won't take that into the equation.</v>

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.080
<v Jane Smythe>We'll do that as well.</v>

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.230
<v Jane Smythe>So how much were you thinking of transferring to your daughters</v>

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Charlie Green>for her? I was thinking, I don't know if it's possible to do that 100,000, so quite a chunk.</v>

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.840
<v Jane Smythe>Granddaughter.</v>

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.500
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.540
<v Jane Smythe>Or</v>

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.320
<v Charlie Green>I don't know what, it won't be tax</v>

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.920
<v Jane Smythe>free.</v>

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Jane Smythe>Because you will be tax because there's only a certain amount that you're allowed to transfer.</v>

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.980
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.360
<v Charlie Green>How much would that be that be 3000 a year or something.</v>

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.090
<v Charlie Green>But then he said the seven-year rule or something very inheritance only rather than tax.</v>

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.410
<v Jane Smythe>So have you got any inheritance tax liability? Is that what you're doing it? Is that the reason why you're thinking of doing it? Partly, Yes as well.</v>

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Jane Smythe>OK, let's have a look and see if you have.</v>

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.700
<v Jane Smythe>HM Is the property going to your daughter? You have an additional 175, three 2/5.</v>

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Jane Smythe>So does it take you above</v>

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.750
<v Charlie Green>that does</v>

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Jane Smythe>does it</v>

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.400
<v Charlie Green>So</v>

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.060
<v Jane Smythe>yeah.</v>

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:24.060
<v Jane Smythe>But if you give that money to your granddaughter and obviously you won't be able to get access to that that's that's given and that sort of course.</v>

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.440
<v Jane Smythe>So you you can do that.</v>

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Jane Smythe>Yes, it's</v>

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Charlie Green>if that's what you did you say that that would be taxable now as well or is that the</v>

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Jane Smythe>because no, if you're doing the seven-year rule you need to obviously sort it out with the solicitor and</v>

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.730
<v Charlie Green>speak with a solicitor has to be done.</v>

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.480
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, because you can leave the money there, but you need something in writing.</v>

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.290
<v Jane Smythe>You need something legally to sort out, isn't it? So obviously I can't sort that out for you can't put the money in that account.</v>

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Jane Smythe>But obviously it's.</v>

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Charlie Green>I think it needs to be in your world to say that I have actually given On this date X amount of money.</v>

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.630
<v Jane Smythe>Needs to be sorted in that way.</v>

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Jane Smythe>So obviously I'll disregard that money because that's money that</v>

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Charlie Green>I need to sort it, Yeah.</v>

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Jane Smythe>Of that you think about it, sure, because if that's what you want to do, then definitely OK because anything above your state.</v>

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Jane Smythe>Would be obviously 40% tax exactly paid.</v>

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Jane Smythe>Now obviously with me going through this now you've just mentioned that.</v>

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.670
<v Jane Smythe>So do you wanna take that advice first or are you sort of wanting me to</v>

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Charlie Green>probably to do that advice first maybe because you're right, I'm thinking of investing the other money.</v>

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Charlie Green>But then once it's invested, I guess as you say it's tied with the house and then if I haven't done anything with it, it will be over 30%, won't it? Yeah.</v>

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Jane Smythe>So because I mean I've not had a look what inheritance tax liability as you've got her anything.</v>

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Jane Smythe>So because you want that sorting out first you need to see an independent financial.</v>

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Charlie Green>I see what you mean.</v>

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:03.330
<v Charlie Green>Oh, OK Well though rather than cancel today's meeting up, can I put that to one side and I will speak.</v>

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.980
<v Charlie Green>Sorry, I thought that was something we could do.</v>

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Jane Smythe>So how much is your house worth now</v>

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.310
<v Charlie Green>Four.</v>

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.900
<v Charlie Green>Well 440?</v>

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.610
<v Jane Smythe>And then obviously with the savings you've got, which is roughly about 250, isn't it roughly</v>

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.680
<v Charlie Green>probably a bit more than that actually.</v>

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, we'll have a look.</v>

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.040
<v Jane Smythe>I'll let you know.</v>

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.920
<v Jane Smythe>We'll let you know how much you have got above.</v>

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, we'll work that out.</v>

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.920
<v Jane Smythe>So now, OK, So you want to have a look at this</v>

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.390
<v Charlie Green>first and then I'll go back and do it that</v>

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.810
<v Jane Smythe>way round.</v>

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Charlie Green>Sure.</v>

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.240
<v Charlie Green>No problem.</v>

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.020
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.380
<v Jane Smythe>So I'm gonna show you now,</v>

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:48.630
<v Charlie Green>please.</v>

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.320
<v Jane Smythe>Your journey with us, I'm just gonna go through.</v>

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.590
<v Jane Smythe>You financial planning journey you said you've done many years ago.</v>

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.780
<v Charlie Green>I did, yes.</v>

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.660
<v Charlie Green>I think that's when I said all the Isas up and</v>

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Jane Smythe>different things, but</v>

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.060
<v Charlie Green>quite a while ago, definitely.</v>

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, sure.</v>

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.350
<v Jane Smythe>So do you know anything about Mango Bank?</v>

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.810

<v Jane Smythe>That's simple, personal fair.</v>

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Jane Smythe>And our customers are protected by the Financial Services Compensation scheme in the UK.</v>

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.910
<v Jane Smythe>So basically under the deposit umbrella up to 85,000 is covered.</v>

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Jane Smythe>Investments come under a different umbrella, all right, so would be protected under that umbrella.</v>

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.560
<v Jane Smythe>But once I know what you're gonna do, that's what I'll explain.</v>

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.430
<v Jane Smythe>Approach to financial planning.</v>

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Jane Smythe>So he what we offer is what we call restricted advice.</v>

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.500
<v Jane Smythe>So that doesn't restrict you in the fact that we invest your money worldwide.</v>

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.760
<v Jane Smythe>Different asset classes, different funds.</v>

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Jane Smythe>The restriction basically means that the administration is kept with Mango Bank,</v>

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.250
<v Charlie Green>right? Yeah.</v>

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Jane Smythe>And the restricted products we have is fixed term investments which is administered by Mango Bank ISA and selected fund ranges which is provided by Mango Bank International.</v>

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.350
<v Charlie Green>OK, OK.</v>

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Charlie Green>So far so good.</v>

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.090
<v Charlie Green>So it's not whole of market then it's purely just about an area.</v>

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:11.420
<v Jane Smythe>So it in the sense we don't sort of do the whole of the market in the sense look at other, your investment will be invested worldwide with different asset classes, HM, but obviously the administration is with Mango Bank.</v>

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Jane Smythe>So you know we don't have the whole of the market portfolio because you're under the Mango Bank umbrella.</v>

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Jane Smythe>Sure.</v>

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.710
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.630
<v Jane Smythe>I'm not independent financial adviser,</v>

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Charlie Green>I thought you was sorry the first.</v>

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.850
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Jane Smythe>Right.</v>

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.060
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Charlie Green>That makes a lot more</v>

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.290
<v Jane Smythe>sense.</v>

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.570
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.550
<v Jane Smythe>So I get employed by Mango Bank.</v>

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.830
<v Jane Smythe>So when you take financial advice, there's advisory, this charges for advice.</v>

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:41.410
<v Jane Smythe>I make that open and transparent, which I will do, but that doesn't come to me, That advisory, I get paid regardless whether you do or don't, right.</v>

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Jane Smythe>That fees paid to Mango Bank? Sure.</v>

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.490
<v Jane Smythe>Independent financial adviser, it's their own business.</v>

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.210
<v Jane Smythe>Whatever they charge, they get.</v>

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.690
<v Jane Smythe>I get paid regardless.</v>

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Jane Smythe>My job is just to make sure that you've got the right.</v>

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Jane Smythe>Solutions for you.</v>

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.160
<v Jane Smythe>OK,</v>

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:55.870
<v Charlie Green>thank you.</v>

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, it means it's restricted, more restricted in terms of what's actually out there, is it?</v>

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:12.080
<v Jane Smythe>Well, not realistically because even when you've got whole of the market, they don't deal even though they say they do, that there's only certain companies they'll deal with as well, right.</v>

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:23.160
<v Jane Smythe>So the restriction basically means, yes, I wondered, Mango Bank and the products that we obviously restricted to will be, obviously we're not sent to their products, we do invest.</v>

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.550
<v Jane Smythe>Black Rock, Fidelity, M&G, we do invest in other funds as well, right? OK.</v>

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Jane Smythe>But it's just the restriction.</v>

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.710
<v Jane Smythe>We're not the whole of the market.</v>

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.160
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Charlie Green>That's good to know.</v>

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Charlie Green>Thank</v>

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:32.530
<v Jane Smythe>you.</v>

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:32.710
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.250
<v Jane Smythe>Is that OK? Yeah, that's fine.</v>

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.830
<v Jane Smythe>OK, make your dreams a reality.</v>

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Jane Smythe>So today is to get to know you.</v>

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.610
<v Jane Smythe>So today I'm not gonna make any recommendations.</v>

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:49.410
<v Jane Smythe>I'll have it's all about how you want, how much you wanna invest, what level of risk you're comfortable with.</v>

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Jane Smythe>It's all about me getting to know you today.</v>

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.170
<v Jane Smythe>Is that OK? But when we explore your needs and wants, we break up your funds into three.</v>

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.510
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so short term is keeping money available for emergencies.</v>

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.490
<v Jane Smythe>Yes, something in your current account that you can get access to.</v>

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.660
<v Jane Smythe>Something like the car breaks down.</v>

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.790
<v Jane Smythe>Breaks down the medium term again is in cash deposit accounts.</v>

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.540
<v Jane Smythe>It's money there that you may need for the future holidays.</v>

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.940
<v Jane Smythe>May wanna give it to kids, whatever, it's there so.</v>

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.370
<v Jane Smythe>It's there.</v>

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.140
<v Jane Smythe>Just fall back off once we're both comfortable.</v>

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Jane Smythe>This is where we have a conversation.</v>

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.070
<v Jane Smythe>You've got enough in these two parts.</v>

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.250
<v Jane Smythe>That's when I look at the longer term to try and make sure that it's doing what it needs to do rather than sit and erode with inflation.</v>

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.100
<v Charlie Green>Exactly.</v>

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.660
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.180
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:32.960
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.310
<v Charlie Green>Fine.</v>

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Charlie Green>Thank you.</v>

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.550
<v Jane Smythe>OK, once I've done that, disappeared.</v>

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:49.270
<v Jane Smythe>Now, once we've got to know you today and got to know what you want to do, I'll prepare my advice, which will be on a detailed report, which I'll present to you next time.</v>

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.770
<v Jane Smythe>And then when I present my advice, I'll go through all charges.</v>

00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:00.020
<v Jane Smythe>You'll know everything before you make an informed decision, right? All the charges, everything that fund manager charges.</v>

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Jane Smythe>I'll tell you about the advisory service fee.</v>

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.830
<v Jane Smythe>Now, any other fees and charges? I'll explain everything you took the second meeting,</v>

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:22.830
<v Charlie Green>OK? I think that was partly one of the reasons I actually left Banana Bank was that initially obviously everything went well and I know things go up and down, but I noticed for quite a few years, I was at working at a loss for about 5 years, HM.</v>

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.560
<v Charlie Green>So that was why I decided HM on the investments that I'd had.</v>

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:32.780
<v Charlie Green>Within each year, I saw that the amount that they were taking was more than what's going actually is.</v>

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.160
<v Charlie Green>So</v>

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.320
<v Jane Smythe>do you know what kind of investment you had? Was it premium investment?</v>

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.530
<v Charlie Green>I can't remember.</v>

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.080
<v Jane Smythe>To be.</v>

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.990
<v Jane Smythe>It's happy.</v>

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.970
<v Jane Smythe>Or did you do something with Banana Bank?</v>

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.630
<v Charlie Green>It was I think, when we first moved to Mango Bank.</v>

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.220
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, quite a while back.</v>

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Charlie Green>Oh, no, hang on a minute.</v>

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Charlie Green>No, maybe it wasn't actually.</v>

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.470
<v Charlie Green>No.</v>

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.650
<v Charlie Green>I think thinking about it now, it may have been with Banana Bank.</v>

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.810
<v Charlie Green>It was before I moved to Mango Bank.</v>

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.730
<v Charlie Green>That's what it was.</v>

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.790
<v Charlie Green>It wasn't with you, It was</v>

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Jane Smythe>with Banana Bank.</v>

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.790
<v Jane Smythe>OK, that makes sense to me because there's nothing here that's just you had.</v>

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:06.930
<v Jane Smythe>You</v>

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:13.130
<v Charlie Green>see, I'm moved across to Mango Bank because everything was just so it seemed that it all started off really well.</v>

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:22.310
<v Charlie Green>But then as the years went, I noticed that the interest was falling and then the charges started getting higher than anything I was making, which seemed ridiculous.</v>

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.520
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.610
<v Jane Smythe>It's ridiculous, isn't it? Mm-hmm.</v>

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Jane Smythe>So that's why we made you aware of all the charges.</v>

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.230
<v Jane Smythe>Everything.</v>

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Jane Smythe>So no, everything before you make that informed decision, which you need to because you don't mind paying as long as you know what you're</v>

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:34.380
<v Charlie Green>paying.</v>

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.230
<v Charlie Green>That's exactly I know.</v>

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.770
<v Jane Smythe>Like I said today, I'm not gonna give you any advice, but I will next time, a little.</v>

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:48.560
<v Jane Smythe>Look, not that past performance is a guide to the future, but you'll know everything, so you can make that informed decision, right? Paying for our advice.</v>

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Jane Smythe>So you'll pay for our financial planning service by an advisory service fee, which is paid when you invest.</v>

00:13:53.810 --> 00:14:03.300
<v Jane Smythe>So when you do with Banana Bank, depending when you did it, I don't know whether you paid an advisory service fee or Commission used to be commissioned in the past, but now it's open and transparent.</v>

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.190
<v Jane Smythe>So we tell you exactly what it's gonna cost you before you take advice.</v>

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.740
<v Charlie Green>OK,</v>

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.810
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, so there's no advisory service fee if you choose not to invest.</v>

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.710
<v Jane Smythe>Advisory service fee will be refunded if you decide to invest but cancel within your relevant cancellation.</v>

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:24.530
<v Jane Smythe>The advisory service fee relates only to advice provided on investment and doesn't include any fees for advice provided on non investment products such as life insurance.</v>

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.850
<v Jane Smythe>A Financial Planning services covered by Advisory Service Terms and Conditions.</v>

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.170
<v Jane Smythe>These are detailed in your About our Financial Planning Service document.</v>

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:39.510
<v Jane Smythe>Before we go ahead with the next meeting, you need to make sure you're happy with these as well as the appropriate advisory service fee.</v>

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:40.960
<v Jane Smythe>Now.</v>

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.170
<v Jane Smythe>It's important that you regularly review your investments.</v>

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.510
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, you don't automatically call you in.</v>

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:55.650
<v Jane Smythe>And the reason we don't do that is obviously our overlooking A5 year term and I think don't think much is gonna change within 12 to 18 months or two years.</v>

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Jane Smythe>So and the FCA said we have to charge to call you in for review.</v>

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.290
<v Jane Smythe>So we'll leave the onus is on yourself.</v>

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.140
<v Jane Smythe>So as and when you want to review just pick the phone up and we'll do it as and when you want it, OK.</v>

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Jane Smythe>Which makes sense.</v>

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Charlie Green>Assume that there'd be like an annual statement</v>

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:10.900
<v Jane Smythe>or something.</v>

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.260
<v Jane Smythe>Anyway, depending on what you what investment it is 1/4 segment.</v>

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.750
<v Jane Smythe>And if you do online banking, you know what it is.</v>

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.150
<v Charlie Green>Perfect.</v>

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:18.670
<v Jane Smythe>There you go.</v>

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:27.140
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so it's the advisory service fee is on top of what you invest and it's 2% of the amount invested.</v>

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.760
<v Jane Smythe>Minimum is 400, maximum is 5000 pounds.</v>

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:35.740
<v Jane Smythe>Say for example invested 50,000, the advisory service fee would be 1000.</v>

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Jane Smythe>Now because this is an open-ended investment, you can invest a regular amount.</v>

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:49.550
<v Jane Smythe>So if you've got surplus funds and it's actually doing nothing sitting in your current account, you can invest it because it gives you that pound cost averaging option as well.</v>

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:54.780
<v Jane Smythe>So if you did do 100.00 for example, that 100 pounds would be times by 36 months.</v>

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.310
<v Jane Smythe>So investing 5000 pounds is 3600.</v>

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.400
<v Jane Smythe>It gets added onto the 50 and the advisory service fee is worked on that 53,600.</v>

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.560
<v Charlie Green>Right.</v>

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.050
<v Charlie Green>Sorry, I didn't</v>

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Jane Smythe>quite investing 50,000 as a lobster.</v>

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.760
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, that's 1000 pounds.</v>

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Jane Smythe>Yes.</v>

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.340
<v Jane Smythe>But you do also decide to do a regular amount each.</v>

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.140
<v Jane Smythe>That's 100 pound.</v>

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, that would be times by 36 months.</v>

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:19.710
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.920
<v Jane Smythe>Which make it 3600 added onto the 50.</v>

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.100
<v Jane Smythe>That's what the advisory said.</v>

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.280
<v Jane Smythe>That's fine.</v>

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.470
<v Jane Smythe>But I don't know you're gonna do.</v>

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.080
<v Jane Smythe>I want to know that.</v>

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:27.700
<v Jane Smythe>I'll explain that</v>

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:28.330
<v Charlie Green>to you.</v>

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:34.620
<v Charlie Green>I think, to be honest, it's probably just gonna be the amount invested rather than adding to it because I don't think I can afford</v>

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.050
<v Jane Smythe>to add.</v>

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.140
<v Jane Smythe>We'll have a look at it, yeah, definitely.</v>

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Jane Smythe>I just, I don't want to pass</v>

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.090

<v Jane Smythe>Nothing at all? No, no.</v>

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.760
<v Jane Smythe>Even at the second minute meeting you won't confirm it unless you're happy and then I'll tell you where it's coming from.</v>

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.050
<v Jane Smythe>Different things anyway.</v>

00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.770
<v Charlie Green>The</v>

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.990
<v Jane Smythe>7th of 888.</v>

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.610
<v Jane Smythe>That OK, that's perfect.</v>

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.490

<v Jane Smythe>OK, now I'm gonna go into the fact find and this is where I'm gonna gather personal financial information.</v>

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:24.280
<v Jane Smythe>So I need to be open and honest because that's what I'm gonna use sure to base my recommendations and the last thing I wanna do is give you the wrong advice.</v>

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.990
<v Jane Smythe>So let's go through this.</v>

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.250
<v Jane Smythe>Have you seen somebody before?</v>

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.690
<v Charlie Green>Not here, no.</v>

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.790
<v Charlie Green>Say it was at Banana Bank.</v>

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Charlie Green>I did the</v>

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.940
<v Jane Smythe>OK, OK, so you've not seen anybody here then? Not</v>

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.690
<v Charlie Green>that I remember.</v>

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Charlie Green>OK,</v>

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Jane Smythe>so planned expenditure for a car and potentially 100.00 for grandma, grandma, grandchild.</v>

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:02.580
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:18.700
<v Jane Smythe>HM Keep your cash reserve, invest for growth and retirement planning, which is I know you're retired, but there's tax benefits are paying into a pension, so I'll make you aware of that, give you an idea on that, OK?</v>

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.240
<v Charlie Green>It's OK.</v>

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.470
<v Jane Smythe>When did you retire?</v>

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.900
<v Charlie Green>I can't remember the exact date.</v>

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.530
<v Charlie Green>58</v>

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.990
<v Jane Smythe>OK, what did you used to do?</v>

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Charlie Green>Account sales manager, but I gave it up to look after my elderly mother who was very poorly.</v>

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.560
<v Charlie Green>So I became a carer for a couple of years and unfortunately she died during lockdown.</v>

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:49.160
<v Charlie Green>So again, hence the need why I can now move from London.</v>

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.750
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, HM, you.</v>

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.310
<v Jane Smythe>You born in the UK? Yeah.</v>

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.760
<v Jane Smythe>You're UK national.</v>

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.390
<v Jane Smythe>Yes.</v>

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Jane Smythe>You don't have to nationality UK domicile.</v>

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:05.440
<v Jane Smythe>UK resident intend to remain in the UK and not plans of moving to the US and become a UK citizen.</v>

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.910
<v Jane Smythe>And no health issues that would have an impact going forward.</v>

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.640
<v Jane Smythe>No.</v>

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.890
<v Jane Smythe>OK, perfect.</v>

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.970
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, we've got your address here because it's all their stuff away and you've got your details here.</v>

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.070
<v Jane Smythe>Have you paid? You said you've not paid into an ISA for this tax year.</v>

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.650
<v Jane Smythe>I think it's perfect.</v>

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:32.820
<v Jane Smythe>And the funds have come because you don't, well, not downsize, but you moved, haven't you? So that's where the fund, how much did you sort of? Gain from moving from London to here then just.</v>

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.110
<v Charlie Green>About 300, No, 200, sorry.</v>

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.870
<v Charlie Green>What would it be? About 275, I think.</v>

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.020
<v Jane Smythe>OK, we're about to London.</v>

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:44.640
<v Jane Smythe>Were you then</v>

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Charlie Green>W London?</v>

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.810
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.120
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.980
<v Jane Smythe>So you draw on your private pension down, don't you? I do.</v>

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.630
<v Jane Smythe>How much do you get coming in</v>

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.270
<v Charlie Green>at the moment? ER, did you want it monthly or annually?</v>

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.610
<v Jane Smythe>Whatever you got is the greatest.</v>

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.120
<v Charlie Green>2600 and 688.</v>

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Jane Smythe>That's on.</v>

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:10.850
<v Jane Smythe>You're losing.</v>

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.330
<v Jane Smythe>It is.</v>

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:11.850
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:12.420
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.560
<v Jane Smythe>And you drew that out four years ago, did you?</v>

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.630
<v Charlie Green>Yes, No, two, two years ago, 60, OK.</v>

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:28.370
<v Jane Smythe>When did you turn 60? Sorry, which one? July, July wasn't there? It's coming back.</v>

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Jane Smythe>So did Mum live in London as well? Then?</v>

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Charlie Green>She lived with me.</v>

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.510
<v Charlie Green>Oh, OK to live with me, OK?</v>

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:41.850
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.890
<v Jane Smythe>And how much is your house worth now</v>

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.890
<v Charlie Green>of 440?</v>

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.170
<v Jane Smythe>OK? Is there a mortgage on it? No.</v>

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.960
<v Jane Smythe>You have to pay it for Mum as well, or Mum's estate.</v>

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Jane Smythe>She didn't have one.</v>

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.780
<v Jane Smythe>Oh, so that's that's good for you.</v>

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.760
<v Jane Smythe>At least you've not had to pay that, no.</v>

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:17.250
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.430
<v Jane Smythe>Do you have any liabilities, any debts? No.</v>

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.380
<v Jane Smythe>You've got a credit card for something.</v>

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.170
<v Jane Smythe>I take, I take that clear that</v>

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.020
<v Charlie Green>regularly.</v>

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.590
<v Charlie Green>I cleared it.</v>

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.330
<v Charlie Green>Actually I was in branch today.</v>

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.220
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.120
<v Jane Smythe>It's just convenient to have, isn't it?</v>

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.570
<v Charlie Green>It is, yes.</v>

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.920
<v Jane Smythe>Then you can just buy what you want and then not worry in a sense</v>

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.920
<v Charlie Green>exactly.</v>

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.740
<v Charlie Green>It's been a lot of expense obviously moving into a new place as well, so.</v>

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.940
<v Charlie Green>And I think also it's my own insurances with you at this time of year,</v>

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Jane Smythe>OK, Everything gets paid at this.</v>

00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.510

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Jane Smythe>just before Christmas, eh? Yep.</v>

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.030
<v Charlie Green>Do you know the last time I moved, it was I worked it out 23 years ago to the month to the date.</v>

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.280
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:11.880
<v Jane Smythe>Oh my God.</v>

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.960
<v Charlie Green>I remember having all of this to do again at the same time.</v>

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.110
<v Jane Smythe>So you just got one daughter that lives in? Yeah.</v>

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.860

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.960
<v Charlie Green>He's got health issues, which is why I wanted to give a little bit extra help to her.</v>

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.030
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.200

<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.600
<v Charlie Green>I think it's got 6000 fatal accident on it as well in addition,</v>

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.460
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so it's just life insurance is yeah.</v>

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:02.200
<v Jane Smythe>Is it whole of life or is it got a term on it? A whole of life? Life.</v>

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.730
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.070
<v Jane Smythe>1000 sent to me.</v>

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.810
<v Jane Smythe>I've put it in trust.</v>

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.320
<v Jane Smythe>Have you put the policy in trust?</v>

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.480
<v Charlie Green>No I haven't.</v>

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.850
<v Jane Smythe>OK, That's something I suggest you do as well.</v>

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.400
<v Charlie Green>I think I did ask them about it, but they said it wasn't possible.</v>

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.440
<v Jane Smythe>Ohh, OK</v>

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.320
<v Charlie Green>because it's such an old one.</v>

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.000
<v Charlie Green>I've had it for so many years.</v>

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:42.700
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.360
<v Charlie Green>Which is a bit of a pain, but.</v>

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.380
<v Jane Smythe>So I'll go into your estate, won't it? That's fortunately, yeah,</v>

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Charlie Green>but I think they just said it wasn't feasible or they they wouldn't move it for me.</v>

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:54.660
<v Charlie Green>So</v>

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.580
<v Jane Smythe>OK, I have no choice.</v>

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.650
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, how much do you pay for it?</v>

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.510
<v Charlie Green>At the moment, each month it's 7.55.</v>

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.020
<v Jane Smythe>Is it?</v>

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.530
<v Jane Smythe>And are you happy with that do you wanna?</v>

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:09.820
<v Charlie Green> Yeah, I'm.</v>

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.460
<v Charlie Green>I've been playing it for so many years.</v>

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.080
<v Charlie Green>I think I took it out when I started work when I was 16.</v>

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:21.340
<v Charlie Green>So OK, it's, it was obviously a lot more at the time but it it's dropped down over the years,</v>

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.850
<v Jane Smythe>of course, because obviously at 16 you would it would be in the 70s, wouldn't it?</v>

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:30.640
<v Charlie Green>Oh, I think it was only about 36 or something back then but it was</v>

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.850
<v Jane Smythe>in the 70s.</v>

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:34.050
<v Jane Smythe>I was</v>

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.720
<v Charlie Green>saying oh I see.</v>

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.080
<v Charlie Green>Sorry.</v>

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.450
<v Charlie Green>Yes, Yes.</v>

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.210
<v Charlie Green>26 I took, you're right.</v>

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.470
<v Jane Smythe>Done the premiums, obviously because you took it younger.</v>

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.060
<v Jane Smythe>It just makes a difference, isn't it?</v>

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.000
<v Charlie Green>But I I figure it would pay for a funeral and whatever else.</v>

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.610
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.060
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.750
<v Jane Smythe>It's sort of, yeah.</v>

00:25:54.790 --> 00:26:01.360
<v Charlie Green>As long as I don't with the I it inheritance tax lose 40% of it, yeah, it should still cover the funeral.</v>

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.190
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.920
<v Jane Smythe>Just got funny.</v>

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.310
<v Jane Smythe>There we go.</v>

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.220
<v Jane Smythe>You said you're happy with it, but this isn't happy with it.</v>

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.040
<v Jane Smythe>For some reason the computer's not happy with it.</v>

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.140
<v Jane Smythe>Ohh what it doesn't.</v>

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.080
<v Jane Smythe>No, no, it's just the dates that's all.</v>

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:33.960
<v Jane Smythe>It's just throwing up little bit above it weren't accept today's date and then.</v>

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:35.770
<v Jane Smythe>There we go.</v>

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.310
<v Jane Smythe>That's fine.</v>

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.850
<v Jane Smythe>Sorted.</v>

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.160
<v Jane Smythe>Sometimes it doesn't register.</v>

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:40.840
<v Jane Smythe>That's all it is.</v>

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.790
<v Jane Smythe>So you're happy with that? OK, you're.</v>

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.240
<v Jane Smythe>And you've not got a pension.</v>

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Charlie Green>I I have private pensions, yes, I've got to pay into that.</v>

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.210
<v Charlie Green>I don't pay into them, but I still have three that</v>

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.610
<v Jane Smythe>I haven't claimed Excellent.</v>

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.470
<v Jane Smythe>So let's take those on board.</v>

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:04.680
<v Jane Smythe>So.</v>

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:06.680
<v Jane Smythe>Who's the first one with?</v>

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Charlie Green>The first one is standard.</v>

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.320
<v Jane Smythe>And it's just in.</v>

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.730
<v Jane Smythe>ER, was it a personal pension that you?</v>

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.450
<v Charlie Green>OK, Well, as a company pension,</v>

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.140
<v Jane Smythe>OK, yeah.</v>

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.560
<v Jane Smythe>Thank you and Standard Life.</v>

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.210
<v Jane Smythe>You know net relevant earnings.</v>

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.110
<v Jane Smythe>There isn't any now because you don't have any income apart from what?</v>

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:48.670
<v Charlie Green>Do.</v>

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.180
<v Jane Smythe>Within the value of it, do you know what I'm saying? Yes,</v>

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:58.010
<v Charlie Green>in November, this last month it was 37,000 and 43 pound.</v>

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:07.400
<v Jane Smythe>Do you know what you could get annually or anything? Have you had that statement, Had a look,</v>

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.170
<v Charlie Green>But to be honest, it's peanuts I think at the moment.</v>

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.140
<v Charlie Green>Well, it's possibly just gone up, but</v>

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:13.740
<v Jane Smythe>let's just to leave it.</v>

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:14.750
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:19.820
<v Charlie Green>I think my thought is with that again is to leave it for my daughter because I think that is outside IH.</v>

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.860
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.940
<v Jane Smythe>So who's that with?</v>

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.120
<v Charlie Green>The second one is with Aviva.</v>

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.120
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.720
<v Jane Smythe>And that was a company pension as well.</v>

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.220
<v Jane Smythe>Take it.</v>

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.170
<v Jane Smythe>Yes, OK.</v>

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:39.560
<v Jane Smythe>That's.</v>

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Jane Smythe>And.</v>

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.070
<v Jane Smythe>And she's that</v>

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.360
<v Charlie Green>That's 36,550.</v>

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.550
<v Jane Smythe>You don't contribute to any of these.</v>

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:05.750
<v Charlie Green>Well.</v>

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.610
<v Charlie Green>So they're the pensions, that's all the pensions I've got, OK?</v>

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:16.730
<v Jane Smythe>Now, do you know anything about pensions at all?</v>

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:26.150
<v Charlie Green>I know that I probably could have paid into it, but to be honest, while I wasn't working and the last few years I haven't had the money to put into it unless I took it out or something else.</v>

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:26.540
<v Charlie Green>So.</v>

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:34.370
<v Charlie Green>I believe I it was part of it would have been tax free and I understand that if I need to draw and then I can take 25% tax free.</v>

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:34.630
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:34.830
<v Charlie Green>I</v>

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:35.380
<v Jane Smythe>I've had.</v>

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.930
<v Jane Smythe>So what I'm exactly.</v>

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.310
<v Jane Smythe>I can't give you pension advice.</v>

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.210
<v Jane Smythe>I'm just gonna give you some factual information.</v>

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:51.510
<v Jane Smythe>So even though like you said, even though you're retired, you can still pay into these pensions and to keep your tax efficient, the maximum we can put in is 2880.</v>

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:57.650
<v Jane Smythe>That, well, maximum is 3600, but what you can put in is 2880 because I'm not working.</v>

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:02.590
<v Jane Smythe>And then you get an uplift of 20% from the government, which makes it 3600,</v>

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.530
<v Charlie Green>right.</v>

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Jane Smythe>OK, yeah.</v>

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Jane Smythe>So you can do that from your savings if you wanted to.</v>

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.160
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, maybe that's the way to go then for it.</v>

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.740
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, because I haven't got HM, I can't give you 20% uplift in anything.</v>

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:15.170
<v Jane Smythe>Sure.</v>

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:23.170
<v Jane Smythe>So when you take come to take it out 25% tax free and the remainder you can draw as an income or lump sum and it's,</v>

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.910
<v Charlie Green>it's outside the IH which is the best bit of all really and so topping up.</v>

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:32.680
<v Charlie Green>Seems to be a good way to go, except to say that both of them seem to be performing</v>

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.240
<v Jane Smythe>quite poorly at the moment.</v>

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.240
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, because of the time, of course.</v>

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, Yeah.</v>

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:42.260
<v Charlie Green>But I was hoping maybe now with inflation and everything else, that they might start to pick up soon too.</v>

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Charlie Green>Yeah,</v>

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.440
<v Jane Smythe>but that is an option that you can add to.</v>

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.230
<v Charlie Green>Presumably I'd need to go to them direct</v>

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.000
<v Jane Smythe>and let them know I want to start making contributions to.</v>

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.200
<v Jane Smythe>You can put a lump sum in or a regular amount.</v>

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.070
<v Jane Smythe>A lump sum, Right, 2800,</v>

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.610
<v Charlie Green>just do that, it would, you say? Flitting between them all.</v>

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.190
<v Jane Smythe>Independent advice if you want to, and if you want some advice, then obviously.</v>

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:07.680
<v Jane Smythe>I don't know.</v>

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.850
<v Jane Smythe>If you do then let me know and then we can sort that out.</v>

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.840
<v Jane Smythe>But you can add to those.</v>

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:12.600
<v Charlie Green>Perfect.</v>

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.860
<v Charlie Green>That's I think the definitely something I'm gonna do straight away then</v>

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:20.400
<v Jane Smythe>sense makes total sense, doesn't it? Just tell me that.</v>

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.360
<v Jane Smythe>So we need to keep an additional 2880 because you need to put that in.</v>

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.330
<v Charlie Green>And that's presumably up until the end of March and then I can do the</v>

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.240
<v Jane Smythe>following year, yes.</v>

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.150
<v Jane Smythe>I'll figure if I don't put the notes on, yeah, not a good idea.</v>

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.080
<v Charlie Green>25.</v>

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.180
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:31:59.160 --> 00:31:59.720
<v Charlie Green>Right.</v>

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.030
<v Jane Smythe>So oops.</v>

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.300
<v Jane Smythe>So you are a new rate taxpayer by the way.</v>

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.200
<v Jane Smythe>I am, yes.</v>

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.760
<v Jane Smythe>Which is</v>

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.440
<v Charlie Green>come about 1000 chalks,</v>

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.160
<v Jane Smythe>yes.</v>

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:20.340
<v Jane Smythe>And you're not planning to draw on these benches, So I take it you're not gonna change, It's gonna stay taxpayer going forward.</v>

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:21.560
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:32.640
<v Charlie Green>Actually at the moment this year I am a taxpayer by about 50 over because I did some private work for OK charity earlier in the year, but that won't be happening again now.</v>

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.180
<v Charlie Green>So the next year will be completely tax free.</v>

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.610
<v Jane Smythe>Do you know what capital gains tax is? Yes.</v>

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:40.990
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Jane Smythe>It's not something that you utilise, I take it.</v>

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.390
<v Jane Smythe>No.</v>

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.690
<v Jane Smythe>OK, perfect.</v>

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.890
<v Jane Smythe>HM, right, so sorted.</v>

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.410
<v Jane Smythe>And the liabilities? Protection we've sorted out and your expenditure now.</v>

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.050
<v Jane Smythe>So let's look at what your outgoings are.</v>

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.570
<v Charlie Green>They they were more.</v>

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.390
<v Charlie Green>I've got other income is not income but other savings as well.</v>

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.710
<v Charlie Green>I don't know do you need to do all savings first do that.</v>

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.140
<v Jane Smythe>No do this outgoings.</v>

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.420
<v Jane Smythe>After it's OK, No, no problem.</v>

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.560
<v Jane Smythe>So council tax?</v>

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.600
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, outgoings.</v>

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.920
<v Charlie Green>Pretty much the same as my comings.</v>

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:12.860
<v Charlie Green>I think it's in.</v>

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:17.460
<v Charlie Green>Goes 98864 and out goes 96724.</v>

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.020
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.500
<v Jane Smythe>So have you got breakdown? Yeah.</v>

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.320
<v Jane Smythe>Council tax currently, Yeah.</v>

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Jane Smythe>Council tax</v>

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Charlie Green>160,</v>

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.650
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.560
<v Jane Smythe>OK, then we've got gas, electricity, water.</v>

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.720
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah,</v>

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:38.000
<v Charlie Green>at the moment I've got 65, but I'm pretty sure that's gonna be doubling in.</v>

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.380
<v Charlie Green>Actually, maybe I should double it now because it's gonna go over otherwise.</v>

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.950
<v Jane Smythe>130, yeah.</v>

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:48.990
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:51.200
<v Jane Smythe>Water.</v>

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Charlie Green>Water again.</v>

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:53.820
<v Charlie Green>I'm waiting to find out.</v>

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Charlie Green>But I suspect 70.</v>

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Charlie Green>Oh no, seven.</v>

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.080
<v Charlie Green>Will it be that here?</v>

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.000
<v Jane Smythe>About 3031,</v>

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:02.150
<v Charlie Green>let's change.</v>

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.700
<v Charlie Green>Bring that down to 30 here</v>

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.760
<v Jane Smythe>usually sounds the</v>

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:11.350
<v Charlie Green>what happened was I went to a metre last year so I've only been paying 5 a month</v>

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:12.460
<v Jane Smythe>OK year</v>

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:16.380
<v Charlie Green>because it went down significantly so it's no what the new one be here.</v>

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:17.020
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.100
<v Jane Smythe>And then brought back broadband.</v>

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.720
<v Charlie Green>Broadband 3950.</v>

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.910
<v Jane Smythe>And telephone?</v>

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.270
<v Charlie Green>HM telephone.</v>

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:42.710
<v Charlie Green>That would be probably mobile, which I've got down as where is it? 7-7</v>

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.790
<v Jane Smythe>pounds, OK.</v>

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.440
<v Jane Smythe>OK so then car.</v>

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Jane Smythe>So your petrol car, insurance, Rd tax.</v>

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.620
<v Charlie Green>I kind of do.</v>

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:09.010
<v Charlie Green>The more different I I've worked out differently because I have a sub account for my of my own to pay for insurance, Rd tax or all of that sort of thing.</v>

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Charlie Green>So that comes under a slightly different banner HM so I sort of put 300 a month away for insurances MOT's S I've got a whole list of other stuff that only comes up annually.</v>

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:23.540
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so 300 would cover that,</v>

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.660
<v Charlie Green>would it? Would 300 a month? Yeah.</v>

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.530
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Jane Smythe>And food and clothing.</v>

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.770
<v Charlie Green>Food, clothing.</v>

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.670
<v Charlie Green>I keep another one for three hundred a month, which is food, clothing and petrol,</v>

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:34.780
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.630
<v Jane Smythe>HM Is there any hobbies that you do that cost you anything?</v>

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.840
<v Charlie Green>There are, but they're included in that 300 as well.</v>

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.680
<v Jane Smythe>Spine OK, no problem.</v>

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.600
<v Jane Smythe>And holidays? Do we pay them as lump sums or a regular amount from your</v>

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:54.820
<v Charlie Green>lump sums that might come out of another fund? Depending.</v>

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:55.620
<v Charlie Green>I haven't been away for</v>

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.750
<v Jane Smythe>quite a while, but yeah, so do we need to include that at the minute?</v>

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.320
<v Charlie Green>HM.</v>

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.940
<v Charlie Green>Maybe I should put 100 a month in for that as well perhaps just to cover it.</v>

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Charlie Green>Yeah I think that's gonna set me way over the top</v>

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.630
<v Jane Smythe>of what my income is says.</v>

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.330
<v Jane Smythe>Shall we</v>

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.850
<v Charlie Green>take it let's take it out and then I can just use the the other fund for it.</v>

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.310
<v Charlie Green>So will it leave it out</v>

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.370
<v Jane Smythe>so there's nothing else is there as we've covered everything</v>

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Charlie Green>So in fact actually one of the three hundreds I think it covers Christmas birthdays things like</v>

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.610
<v Jane Smythe>that as well.</v>

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.390
<v Jane Smythe>So it's</v>

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.600
<v Charlie Green>pretty much everything.</v>

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.520
<v Jane Smythe>OK okeydokey so your monthly.</v>

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.510
<v Jane Smythe>Incoming obviously.</v>

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:41.180
<v Jane Smythe>Well, let's do the savings, but at the minute because the savings will have some interest on it, won't it? So the minute you've got.</v>

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.860
<v Jane Smythe>96724 coming in.</v>

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.280
<v Jane Smythe>Mm-hmm.</v>

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.720
<v Jane Smythe>There's a shortfall of 7.31.</v>

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:52.640
<v Charlie Green>No, sorry, come in, in.</v>

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.630
<v Charlie Green>Is 98864 going out? Is 96724.</v>

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.060
<v Charlie Green>Let me just.</v>

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.260
<v Charlie Green>I think maybe I've not added it up very well on there for you.</v>

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:01.030
<v Jane Smythe>OK, let me just.</v>

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.130
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.050
<v Jane Smythe>So your pension is 11,606 and 88.</v>

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.610
<v Jane Smythe>Yes.</v>

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.440
<v Charlie Green>Which comes, oh, sorry, no, no, my mistake.</v>

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.540
<v Charlie Green>I I've done it wrong.</v>

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.410
<v Charlie Green>My pension is, it's not that.</v>

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.310
<v Charlie Green>Let me work it out.</v>

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.950
<v Charlie Green>It's nine, eight, 864 * 12.</v>

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.050
<v Charlie Green>I I see what I've done.</v>

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.800
<v Charlie Green>I've multiplied by my outgoing rather than income.</v>

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Jane Smythe>HM What is it? Monthly</v>

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.490
<v Charlie Green>988-649-9886,</v>

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:26.870
<v Jane Smythe>four.</v>

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.610
<v Jane Smythe>OK, fine.</v>

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:27.930
<v Jane Smythe>Don't worry,</v>

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:28.690
<v Charlie Green>I'll get now.</v>

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.490
<v Charlie Green>Is the 96724</v>

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.910
<v Jane Smythe>OK? That's fine.</v>

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.910
<v Jane Smythe>That makes sense around.</v>

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:45.830
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, that makes sense to you now, don't it? Yeah, 98864, So you've got 14.00 surplus each month, which is what you said is pretty much on par with what you've got coming in and going out.</v>

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.990
<v Jane Smythe>So obviously, OK.</v>

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.380
<v Jane Smythe>Savings and investments.</v>

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.720
<v Jane Smythe>So let's just double check what you've got here.</v>

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:54.570
<v Jane Smythe>So you've got 200.</v>

00:37:55.350 --> 00:38:02.870
<v Charlie Green>HM and one of those accounts, actually, I'm gonna be closing shortly because it was my mother's account, but I looked after it for her.</v>

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.190
<v Charlie Green>So I'm separate with,</v>

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.790
<v Jane Smythe>which is Mum's account, the 1540.</v>

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.130
<v Jane Smythe>So I need to take that out.</v>

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.810
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, if we could do, please, that's</v>

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.290
<v Jane Smythe>fine.</v>

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.800
<v Charlie Green>I need to divide that up amongst family and send it to them.</v>

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:16.840
<v Jane Smythe>OK, no problem.</v>

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.520
<v Jane Smythe>So 218.</v>

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.840
<v Jane Smythe>Right.</v>

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:31.390
<v Charlie Green>I'm sorry.</v>

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.350
<v Jane Smythe>Do you think? OK.</v>

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:49.910
<v Jane Smythe>So 123 there isn't, is it interest up to the 20,000 above that there isn't obviously so.</v>

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:56.390
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Jane Smythe>And then the cash ISA which you've got? Which is got 10,419 currents in there.</v>

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.530
<v Charlie Green>That interest rate is crazy, so.</v>

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:17.790
<v Jane Smythe>Dokey.</v>

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.760
<v Jane Smythe>So 228,708, that's what we've got, isn't it?</v>

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.170
<v Charlie Green>200</v>

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:28.300
<v Jane Smythe>and 18200 and 28228, Yes 7/08/17.</v>

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.880
<v Jane Smythe>P 708 Really.</v>

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:32.060
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:42.740
<v Jane Smythe>So yeah, 700 and 47742.</v>

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.800
<v Jane Smythe>You inheritance tax liability, Yeah.</v>

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.070
<v Jane Smythe>So you're allowed 500,000 exactly.</v>

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.790
<v Charlie Green>And there's more actually on top of that as well.</v>

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.410
<v Charlie Green>I've got that will probably fall into it.</v>

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:57.950
<v Jane Smythe>So have you got funds elsewhere? Yeah.</v>

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.130
<v Jane Smythe>OK, let's add those on there.</v>

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.470
<v Charlie Green>So the first one I've got is a shares,</v>

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.430
<v Jane Smythe>yeah.</v>

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.490
<v Charlie Green>And the value of those at today's I think is 27,000</v>

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.470
<v Jane Smythe>who's the shares with</v>

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:18.910
<v Charlie Green>Microsoft.</v>

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:33.130
<v Jane Smythe>Microsoft.</v>

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:36.550
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:44.630
<v Jane Smythe>So you've got 21,000 and 2727 with them? They're just single shares you do.</v>

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.190
<v Jane Smythe>Did you buy them?</v>

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Charlie Green>One? I work for the companies as it was, Reuters.</v>

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:50.370
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:56.940
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.520
<v Jane Smythe>I take it you've seen them go up and down.</v>

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.580
<v Charlie Green>They actually, to be fair with that company, they've only ever gone up,</v>

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:03.570
<v Jane Smythe>OK,</v>

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:04.660
<v Charlie Green>Only ever gone up.</v>

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:07.790
<v Charlie Green>Some of them I bought at ridiculously low prices.</v>

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.600
<v Charlie Green>Life just helped them for years.</v>

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:14.030
<v Jane Smythe>So did you invest in them yourself as well or did you just do the same</v>

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.280
<v Charlie Green>share save? OK,</v>

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:17.640
<v Jane Smythe>yeah,</v>

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.640
<v Charlie Green>it was well worth it.</v>

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.440
<v Charlie Green>And they gave free shares as well.</v>

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:21.200
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.710
<v Jane Smythe>But you do know, obviously that's the highest risk.</v>

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.210
<v Jane Smythe>There's only one share, isn't there?</v>

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.690
<v Charlie Green>Oh, sorry, it's not just one share, it's 720 shares.</v>

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.260
<v Charlie Green>Sorry.</v>

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.110
<v Jane Smythe>No, no, no, that's fine.</v>

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:35.470
<v Jane Smythe>No, no, no.</v>

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.650
<v Jane Smythe>What I'm saying is only invested in one company.</v>

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.130
<v Jane Smythe>It is.</v>

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.690
<v Charlie Green>But in fairness, I've had it with them for 30 years.</v>

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, no, no, that's fine.</v>

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Jane Smythe>I'm just saying, I know it's no diversification.</v>

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:51.070
<v Charlie Green>Told me to move it, but with the amount that it's gone up, I mean, they're worth 38 now.</v>

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.870
<v Charlie Green>I paid about 5 for them.</v>

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.140
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.360
<v Jane Smythe>You paid 5 and worth what?</v>

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Charlie Green>ER, 3838 pound now.</v>

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:08.580
<v Charlie Green>So I mean, even if they did fall significantly.</v>

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:13.500
<v Charlie Green>I just think that they're the safest bet for me that I I've never wanted to move.</v>

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.770
<v Charlie Green>That's</v>

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Jane Smythe>totally fine.</v>

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:18.210
<v Jane Smythe>It was just so there's not diversified in different companies.</v>

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.350
<v Jane Smythe>I wanna say it's just with one.</v>

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.360
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah that's the only thing I'm aware of the risk</v>

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Charlie Green>but happy with it.</v>

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.610
<v Charlie Green>Yeah that's one risk I'm not I am risk adverse.</v>

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:27.710
<v Charlie Green>Apart from that,</v>

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.240
<v Jane Smythe>OK who's?</v>

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.960
<v Charlie Green>With the other one is Premium Bonds.</v>

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Jane Smythe>So you've got Premium Bonds, OK.</v>

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.540
<v Jane Smythe>They're in cash, so there's no to that.</v>

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.510
<v Jane Smythe>So National Savings, have you won on these?</v>

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.140
<v Jane Smythe>Oh, yes, OK.</v>

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.320
<v Charlie Green>And in fact, we're not big, not big at all.</v>

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.600
<v Charlie Green>But every little helps, as they say.</v>

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.520
<v Charlie Green>In fact, actually I need to look it up because I've just won again this week.</v>

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:53.480
<v Charlie Green>Excellent.</v>

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Charlie Green>So I think they pay more interest.</v>

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:00.960
<v Charlie Green>In the last year, I've had more interest from those than I have in any other account.</v>

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:11.070
<v Charlie Green>How much have you got in there, 6300? And anything else, I think that's it for now.</v>

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:11.850
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:17.970
<v Jane Smythe>So that does take your body inheritance tax liability, which we'll finish off and then, yeah, I can tell me what you want to do really.</v>

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.750
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:44.700
<v Jane Smythe>So knowledge and experience, you've got these shares, yes, HM, but I guess it's limited experience because it's not something that you bought it share save scheme, wasn't it? But you said you invested with Banana Bank as well.</v>

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:45.710
<v Jane Smythe>What was that</v>

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:48.780
<v Charlie Green>HM? Do you know? I can't even remember now</v>

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:49.350
<v Jane Smythe>HM.</v>

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:52.670
<v Charlie Green>I it, it was.</v>

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.720
<v Charlie Green>So it was about</v>

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:54.730
<v Jane Smythe>20 years ago.</v>

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:55.180
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:59.440
<v Jane Smythe>So do you think it was unit trust and or exhaust stocks and shares and I think it was more stocks</v>

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:02.020
<v Charlie Green>and shares but they didn't perform very well at all.</v>

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.140
<v Jane Smythe>HM</v>

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:04.580
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.670
<v Jane Smythe>And do you know what kind of risk you did? It took</v>

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.020
<v Charlie Green>I think at the time it was medium risk as I was a lot younger back then.</v>

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:22.740
<v Charlie Green>But to be fair, I think my risk level is these days as I'm getting older, it is reducing.</v>

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.440
<v Jane Smythe>I totally understand that as well.</v>

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:27.640
<v Jane Smythe>I think as you get older, you do tend to be a little bit more cautious, isn't it?</v>

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:29.280
<v Jane Smythe>So yeah, you</v>

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:44.020
<v Jane Smythe>from what you say, you lost money on that, didn't you? I think it's through that late is at 3:00.</v>

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Jane Smythe>O'clock.</v>

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:45.950
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, the closer branch at 3:00.</v>

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:46.430
<v Jane Smythe>That's fine.</v>

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.700
<v Jane Smythe>We're fine because we're in here.</v>

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:48.260
<v Charlie Green>Thank you.</v>

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:50.540
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.530
<v Jane Smythe>So you just lost money basically from what you're saying, aren't you? I did</v>

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:53.750
<v Charlie Green>that.</v>

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.610
<v Charlie Green>That was through that.</v>

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:54.950
<v Charlie Green>W</v>

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.570
<v Jane Smythe>absolutely.</v>

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:55.860
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:56.380
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:01.170
<v Jane Smythe>Have you ever invested in structured in deposits? No structured investments?</v>

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.570
<v Charlie Green>HM No, I don't think so.</v>

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:03.900
<v Charlie Green>Actually</v>

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:05.500
<v Jane Smythe>thinking about it with Banana Bank,</v>

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:08.110
<v Charlie Green>they did used to send me a plan on it.</v>

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:12.660
<v Charlie Green>It wasn't just shares, it was it other investments or different things and they sent me AM.</v>

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.910
<v Charlie Green>I remember it was some sort of plan where it was a  design.</v>

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.550
<v Charlie Green>Show me where everything was.</v>

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.210
<v Charlie Green>That's it.</v>

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.730
<v Charlie Green>They did do asset</v>

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.240
<v Jane Smythe>classes.</v>

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.890
<v Jane Smythe>Yes, Now you mentioned it unit trust analytics.</v>

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Charlie Green>I don't know would have been included in that sort.</v>

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.230
<v Charlie Green>If it's if it's</v>

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Jane Smythe>if it's outside of stocks and shares ISA, then it could have been.</v>

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.800
<v Jane Smythe>If it's if it's a, if it was invested in Pepsi stocks</v>

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:37.190
<v Charlie Green>and shares, I don't know.</v>

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:44.010
<v Charlie Green>I think it was outside of stocks and shares and because thinking about it, the pie, I remember them saying part of it was in Asia and it was all scattered</v>

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:44.480
<v Jane Smythe>around.</v>

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:49.550
<v Jane Smythe>So that investment could be in a nicer and it could be outside an ISA.</v>

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.430
<v Jane Smythe>It the ISA is just the wrapper.</v>

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.120
<v Jane Smythe>All right.</v>

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.710
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:53.990
<v Charlie Green>So OK.</v>

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.810
<v Charlie Green>I'm not sure of anything honest.</v>

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:56.290
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.910
<v Charlie Green>I don't think I've got the information.</v>

00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.350
<v Jane Smythe>No, it's fine.</v>

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.310
<v Jane Smythe>It's just trying to ask whether, you know, remember it.</v>

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.210
<v Jane Smythe>So it's been a little while.</v>

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.820
<v Jane Smythe>So yeah, no problem.</v>

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Jane Smythe>Investment bonds, no.</v>

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:08.860
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:12.970
<v Jane Smythe>And venture capital trust is a high risk investment which I assume you haven't</v>

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:19.360
<v Charlie Green>Well I think that they put 5% in or they broke this percentage down into high risk, medium risk</v>

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:20.140
<v Jane Smythe>and then low risk.</v>

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:26.280
<v Jane Smythe>So as they had a portfolio funds folio, yeah, so venture capital trust would be something that.</v>

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Jane Smythe>No, I don't think you would have done that unless you earned X amount of money and you had low.</v>

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.210
<v Jane Smythe>I don't think so.</v>

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.790
<v Jane Smythe>And you cash in 20 years ago, do you say</v>

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:42.720
<v Charlie Green>yes, probably not quite 20 years? Maybe 15 years ago, I cashed in.</v>

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.850
<v Jane Smythe>And can you remember what you lost? Probably about 5000.</v>

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.180
<v Jane Smythe>Do you know what you originally put in then?</v>

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:55.450
<v Charlie Green>It would have been about maybe 20,000 or something.</v>

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.020
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.860
<v Charlie Green>So quite a significant chunk.</v>

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.740
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, over those years.</v>

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.020
<v Jane Smythe>How long did you leave it in?</v>

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:12.490
<v Charlie Green>About 5 years? OK, so the first two years went really well, but then the next two years and when I queried it with them, they said, oh, of course it goes up, it goes down, but it will balance out, leave it, leave it.</v>

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.830
<v Charlie Green>About the end of the five years it was all going in One Direction and there was</v>

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:21.040
<v Jane Smythe>absolutely fund managers weren't doing what they needed to do then really isn't it at the end of the day.</v>

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:22.730
<v Charlie Green>Oh, shoot.</v>

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:23.570
<v Jane Smythe>That's yeah.</v>

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.090
<v Jane Smythe>OK, OK.</v>

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:29.630
<v Jane Smythe>HM Yes, fluctuation.</v>

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.460
<v Jane Smythe>So you have experienced volatility.</v>

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:32.610
<v Jane Smythe>You have seen it go up and down.</v>

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Jane Smythe>But once you manage yourself, do you see, if you don't, then that's fine.</v>

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.700
<v Jane Smythe>I would say you're an investor once, an experienced investor, no.</v>

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.090
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.050
<v Charlie Green>HM.</v>

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:47.610
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so now with the money you've got, we're gonna talk about the three pots.</v>

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:48.090
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.670
<v Jane Smythe>You OK with that? Umm.</v>

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.250
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Jane Smythe>So let's.</v>

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Charlie Green>Pick up.</v>

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.510
<v Jane Smythe>Sorry about that.</v>

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.270
<v Jane Smythe>Don't.</v>

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:27.990
<v Jane Smythe>Somebody else is on there, which you don't need.</v>

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:29.420
<v Jane Smythe>Just bear with me.</v>

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.210
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.800
<v Jane Smythe>There we go.</v>

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:17.840
<v Jane Smythe>Two, say you're an investor and you said your monthly outgoings is 9.</v>

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.860
<v Charlie Green>96724.</v>

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:22.760
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:27.190
<v Jane Smythe>In total money you've guys 22870.</v>

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:32.760
<v Jane Smythe>No, it's not, it's moved because we had a look at that thing 235, I think it was it.</v>

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.280
<v Jane Smythe>OK, let's have a 26216.</v>

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:56.740
<v Jane Smythe>262008 OK, no debts, no liabilities, but need to obviously keep 110th of the car</v>

00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:58.120
<v Jane Smythe>and then pension</v>

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:02.600
<v Charlie Green>and the pension and also I probably want to leave the Microsoft shares where they are.</v>

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.620
<v Jane Smythe>I'll I'll do all of that.</v>

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:05.680
<v Jane Smythe>This is Money that I won't take into equation.</v>

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:11.390
<v Jane Smythe>So that money, the 100, the pension and the card is money that's gonna be spent come out of your equation.</v>

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.780
<v Jane Smythe>You see what I'm saying exactly, and the shares I will take out anyway.</v>

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:15.560
<v Jane Smythe>So brilliant.</v>

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.500
<v Jane Smythe>You can't invest what you've already invested if that makes sense.</v>

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.090
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, that makes perfect sense.</v>

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:20.600
<v Jane Smythe>So.</v>

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:24.780
<v Jane Smythe>Lasting.</v>

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:26.690
<v Jane Smythe>10/20.</v>

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:31.300
<v Jane Smythe>It's because it's cold.</v>

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.120
<v Charlie Green>I know.</v>

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.830
<v Jane Smythe>And it's not warm in here.</v>

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.050
<v Jane Smythe>I was expecting it to be warm.</v>

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:43.100
<v Jane Smythe>And I said to these guys, of course you told me and I could have actually put a jumper on something warm on, but instead, oh, never mind.</v>

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.300
<v Jane Smythe>So that's gonna take 112 out.</v>

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:49.690
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so that's the 100 for your granddaughter, If that's what you decide to do, obviously.</v>

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.110
<v Jane Smythe>We'll talk about that in a second.</v>

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:54.840
<v Jane Smythe>10,000 of your car and 2800 for the pension.</v>

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:55.510
<v Jane Smythe>Perfect.</v>

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:56.200
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.280
<v Jane Smythe>If you take that out, what you've got left is 149.</v>

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Jane Smythe>1000, OK, OK.</v>

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:11.940
<v Jane Smythe>So you've got 149,128 out of that.</v>

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:20.620
<v Jane Smythe>You know, we talked about the emergency part where you can get access to it straight away in case something happens, not the medium one where it's still cash reserve exactly.</v>

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.680
<v Jane Smythe>So do you know how much you'd need to keep or can give you guidance?</v>

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.080
<v Charlie Green>I'd need guidance</v>

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:28.640
<v Jane Smythe>probably I would say minimum 4000 in the first part, yes,</v>

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:29.880
<v Charlie Green>yes, sounds good.</v>

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.360
<v Jane Smythe>OK, the second part.</v>

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:36.770
<v Jane Smythe>Again, do you know how much you would want to keep or can give you guidance? Again,</v>

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.520
<v Charlie Green>guidance again, I would say,</v>

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.840
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so I would say minimum 30,000, OK.</v>

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:44.800
<v Jane Smythe>And I'd include the 4000 in there.</v>

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.540
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:46.020
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:47.640
<v Jane Smythe>Would that be OK? Yeah, No, that</v>

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:48.440
<v Charlie Green>sounds good.</v>

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:58.470
<v Jane Smythe>HM take away the 27 that you've already got in the shares, So the maximum you can invest, if you wanted to, would be 92,000.</v>

00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:59.100
<v Charlie Green>Sure.</v>

00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.820
<v Charlie Green>OK,</v>

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.820
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, No, I'm happy with that.</v>

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.420
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Charlie Green>So it'd be good to see what I could get in terms</v>

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.460
<v Jane Smythe>of return for that.</v>

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.860
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.120
<v Jane Smythe>So I would because there's advice.</v>

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.740
<v Jane Smythe>So shall we say 90? Yeah, because there's an advisory service fee.</v>

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:17.200
<v Jane Smythe>So the money has to come out of</v>

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.760
<v Charlie Green>what you've got.</v>

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:19.780
<v Charlie Green>Oh, sorry, they're advisory fee was</v>

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.960
<v Jane Smythe>how much two percent, 2%.</v>

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:25.050
<v Charlie Green>So that be on top 2018</v>

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:25.450
<v Jane Smythe>hundred.</v>

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:26.030
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:27.960
<v Jane Smythe>OK, I do Now is that a one off</v>

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:31.970
<v Charlie Green>fee did you say? And then no interest or anything else comes off after that</v>

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Jane Smythe>the management fees and there's a hub fee, which again I'll explain that.</v>

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:41.000
<v Jane Smythe>You at unexpected tell you all the charges on it? Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:41.720
<v Jane Smythe>OK with that.</v>

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:42.490
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, sure.</v>

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:13.080
<v Jane Smythe>Again, it depends on what you want as well, because obviously with the IG, what you want to do with that first or do you know what I mean? So exactly,</v>

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:13.560
<v Charlie Green>yeah,</v>

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:15.350
<v Jane Smythe>let's talk about that in a second.</v>

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:25.180
<v Jane Smythe>Right, let's get back into.</v>

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:31.530
<v Jane Smythe>So now we've worked that out, we worked out HM emergency funds you're going to keep, which is 4000.</v>

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.610
<v Jane Smythe>Don't take.</v>

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.200
<v Jane Smythe>We'll keep that from.</v>

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:39.350
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:53.800
<v Jane Smythe>You have made a will.</v>

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:54.760
<v Jane Smythe>You said I have.</v>

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:55.180
<v Jane Smythe>Yes.</v>

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.460
<v Jane Smythe>Happy.</v>

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.760
<v Jane Smythe>Recently had it reviewed.</v>

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:57.500
<v Jane Smythe>Yes.</v>

00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:58.170
<v Charlie Green>When was that?</v>

00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:59.200
<v Jane Smythe>Last year.</v>

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:00.650
<v Jane Smythe>OK, excellent.</v>

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:07.310
<v Jane Smythe>It's</v>

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Charlie Green>drawn up in the UK, isn't it? Yeah.</v>

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.890
<v Jane Smythe>OK, sounds good.</v>

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:16.890
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, children.</v>

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.560
<v Jane Smythe>OK, no problem.</v>

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:21.790
<v Jane Smythe>Right.</v>

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.590
<v Jane Smythe>I'm gonna go through.</v>

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.500
<v Jane Smythe>We're gonna go through how the investment market works, first of all.</v>

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Jane Smythe>So we're gonna go through risk.</v>

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.260
<v Jane Smythe>HM the first parties were when you talked about the page.</v>

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:34.010
<v Jane Smythe>I'm just gonna educate you how the investment market works, the different asset classes.</v>

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:37.210
<v Jane Smythe>HM so that's what I'm gonna explain to you now.</v>

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.250
<v Jane Smythe>But before I do that, I just need to do this, so.</v>

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:41.750
<v Charlie Green>For me.</v>

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.020
<v Jane Smythe>Move until I've done this, you say so.</v>

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:48.680
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:51.790
<v Jane Smythe>There we go.</v>

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:52.720
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.540
<v Jane Smythe>Right, so</v>

00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Charlie Green>I've got this brochure for you which is here.</v>

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:06.620
<v Jane Smythe>i'm gonna go through it on here which makes it a little bit easier</v>

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.610
<v Charlie Green>for you sure OK so that investing</v>

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:18.050
<v Jane Smythe>mm-hmm planning your investment goals with us should you save or invest the path to investing what's inside your investment OK.</v>

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:27.390
<v Jane Smythe>Where is your money invested? So the money when we invest your money, we just don't invest in one area, the four different asset classes to give you that further diversification.</v>

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:31.690
<v Jane Smythe>So cash proportion of investment is likely to be held in cash.</v>

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:34.560
<v Jane Smythe>Having cash in your investment lowers your exposure to risk.</v>

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.650
<v Jane Smythe>However, it's good to remember that cash is devalued when inflation rates are higher than interest rates.</v>

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:41.030
<v Jane Smythe>Exactly.</v>

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:43.780
<v Jane Smythe>And that's the reason why we're here, isn't it? Mm-hmm.</v>

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:48.120
<v Jane Smythe>So you've got enough in cash, but obviously we need to look at something else and try and keep that going.</v>

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:49.060
<v Jane Smythe>Bonds.</v>

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:54.680
<v Jane Smythe>Bonds are typically offered by companies or governments who use the money raised to fund projects or operations.</v>

00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:59.750
<v Jane Smythe>When investing in bonds, you commonly benefit from a fixed return over an agreed timescale.</v>

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:06.330
<v Jane Smythe>However, as bonds are linked to the financial security of the issuing organisation, they carry a certain degree of risk.</v>

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.930
<v Jane Smythe>UK government bonds are classed as the lowest risk compared to the corporate bonds.</v>

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:19.570
<v Charlie Green>To be honest, that was where I was heading next I think was a good UK government bonds because I think they've got the highest interest rate at the moment.</v>

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:24.490
<v Charlie Green>I'm compared to banks and building societies, etc.</v>

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:32.610
<v Jane Smythe>So how this works is like for example, if the government needed to raise some capital, they've come to financial institutions like us, you know about bonds,</v>

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.660
<v Charlie Green>do a little bit, just that little bit, but keep going, keep going,</v>

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:40.910
<v Jane Smythe>come to financial institutions like as we lend them that money could be five years, 10 years or 100 years.</v>

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.050
<v Jane Smythe>The nominal value will always come back.</v>

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:48.950
<v Jane Smythe>The risk element is because they bought and sold on the Stock Exchange, so interest rates going up and that has an impact as well.</v>

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.630
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, company bonds.</v>

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:52.040
<v Jane Smythe>She's corporate bonds.</v>

00:56:52.410 --> 00:57:05.730
<v Jane Smythe>So government bonds are called guilt company bonds, called corporate bonds and these are with companies who need to borrow funds and that could be higher risk because if companies can't promises or go into liquidation that can have an element of risk.</v>

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:08.150
<v Jane Smythe>However, we don't invest in one bond, it spread out.</v>

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.760
<v Jane Smythe>Sure.</v>

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:09.950
<v Jane Smythe>So your balance is yeah,</v>

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:11.320
<v Charlie Green>OK, yeah.</v>

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:18.560
<v Jane Smythe>Property investing commercial properties such as warehouses, offices and shopping centres connects your returns to the properties value and rental income.</v>

00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:24.600
<v Jane Smythe>Compared to cash and bonds, investing in property can generate higher returns and protect your money against inflation.</v>

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:31.530
<v Jane Smythe>However, property values can still drop, and any properties that proves hard to sell can cause delay should you need access to your money properly.</v>

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:39.180
<v Jane Smythe>Shares, owning stocks and shares is also known as equities, typically refers to own a portion of a publicly traded company.</v>

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:47.480
<v Jane Smythe>So the share that you've got, for example, that's a single company share, you have voting rights, you get dividend income and the share price goes up and you get the value of that share.</v>

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:48.900
<v Jane Smythe>That's the highest risk.</v>

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:51.740
<v Jane Smythe>And Mango Bank won't invest in single company shares, Sure.</v>

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:58.420
<v Jane Smythe>And the reason it won't do that is so for example, you invested this 90,000 in BHS last year, what would have happened?</v>

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.570
<v Charlie Green>Exactly, yeah.</v>

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.140
<v Jane Smythe>But if you invested in Amazon and BHS do you think would have happened</v>

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.420
<v Charlie Green>it should balance itself and that's what we do,</v>

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.210
<v Jane Smythe>that's it's portfolio investment.</v>

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:16.650
<v Jane Smythe>So when you invest into a portfolio you don't get dividend income whatever it generally well you don't get it to you, whatever it generates goes back into the fund sure.</v>

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:25.130
<v Jane Smythe>And it's professional fund managers managing this portfolio for you HM So that it calculated risk the manager forward-looking projection.</v>

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.650
<v Jane Smythe>What these fund managers do, they have afford, look at the educated HM so they know what they're doing.</v>

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:32.140
<v Jane Smythe>So there's market conditions.</v>

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:33.690
<v Jane Smythe>They know everything that's happening.</v>

00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:35.060
<v Jane Smythe>There's times when they don't know.</v>

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.270
<v Jane Smythe>It's like COVID couldn't predict that.</v>

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:39.600
<v Jane Smythe>However, saying that HM.</v>

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:47.310
<v Jane Smythe>Before we went and we had COVID in March, the fund managers knew something was happening in November, so their charts started moving the funds.</v>

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:54.510
<v Jane Smythe>They didn't expect it to be the way it was and predict what was gonna happen, but they knew something was happening, so they started moving funds around.</v>

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:55.670
<v Jane Smythe>HM.</v>

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.450
<v Jane Smythe>Ukraine and things like that, they can't predict things.</v>

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:01.110
<v Jane Smythe>Certain things they can't predict.</v>

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.950
<v Jane Smythe>But parliament changes, government changes.</v>

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.170
<v Jane Smythe>They already have those equations in mind anyway.</v>

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:09.470
<v Jane Smythe>It's just when something's drastically happened.</v>

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:10.880
<v Charlie Green>Course</v>

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.990
<v Jane Smythe>they can't predict, but they are professionals who are actually managing.</v>

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.800
<v Jane Smythe>That's what I'm saying that we're so must have obviously not had the right.</v>

00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:21.280
<v Charlie Green>Well, you know, it was painful.</v>

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:24.920
<v Charlie Green>It definitely, because we were paying them to lose money, basically.</v>

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:25.320
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Jane Smythe>So you're paying more than you are making, really.</v>

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.690
<v Jane Smythe>Setting an ambition to beat inflation.</v>

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:38.120
<v Jane Smythe>So if you had 10,000 in 2007 and you just leave everything in cash, that value actually is gonna drop by 5900.</v>

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:43.440
<v Jane Smythe>84 And bearing in mind that just no offence, you are still young,</v>

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:45.720
<v Charlie Green>you've potentially got another at least</v>

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.160
<v Jane Smythe>1520 years exactly</v>

00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:48.780
<v Charlie Green>and</v>

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:57.840
<v Jane Smythe>obviously if we don't keep in pace because you've got state pension coming in four years time, yes, so that'll help boost as well as well.</v>

00:59:57.850 --> 00:59:58.480
<v Jane Smythe>So you can have,</v>

00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:59.630
<v Charlie Green>I mean at the minute you've got</v>

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:00.970
<v Jane Smythe>just 14.00.</v>

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:08.160
<v Jane Smythe>So what I'm thinking is obviously if we're investing this money, there's only you've just got enough incoming outgoings going out</v>

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:08.980
<v Charlie Green>HM.</v>

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:16.370
<v Jane Smythe>How would you manage? Obviously I guess we've put more in there, holidays, not holidays and Christmas and birthdays.</v>

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:21.180
<v Jane Smythe>So would you sort of reduce that? Would you live to your means? Is that what you would do? HM</v>

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.900
<v Charlie Green>possibly.</v>

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:36.580
<v Charlie Green>But now I think we've, as I'm getting older, I'm thinking of dipping into pots for holidays and things like that, OK, Because yeah, I I personally, I think the next 10 years will be the time when I'm still mobile and able to get around and enjoy it.</v>

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:40.160
<v Charlie Green>So I'm thinking the next 10 years I want to be able to enjoy.</v>

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:41.690
<v Charlie Green>And live quite comfortably.</v>

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:42.340
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.570
<v Jane Smythe>But you haven't got the surplus you are saving for holidays</v>

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:48.690
<v Charlie Green>on your saying that's it within it.</v>

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:57.190
<v Charlie Green>So that's probably I'd still for the holidays that I would expect I probably need to dip into the medium fund or something emergency medium plan.</v>

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.050
<v Charlie Green>I would see that as being part of the the pots that I would use if</v>

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.100
<v Jane Smythe>that's fine.</v>

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:05.160
<v Jane Smythe>I just wanted to make sure because obviously there's only small shortfall.</v>

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:05.570
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.340
<v Charlie Green>So it's</v>

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:07.370
<v Jane Smythe>disposable income.</v>

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.510
<v Jane Smythe>I just wanted to know where you get</v>

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:08.750
<v Charlie Green>it from.</v>

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.340
<v Charlie Green>So if you need exactly it's pot.</v>

01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:11.690
<v Charlie Green>That's fine.</v>

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:12.260
<v Jane Smythe>That's fine.</v>

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:14.920
<v Jane Smythe>That's what it's there for anyway, isn't it? Yeah, OK.</v>

01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:17.220
<v Jane Smythe>Time in the market, not timing the market.</v>

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:19.630
<v Jane Smythe>So this is what happens in the stock market.</v>

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:25.200
<v Jane Smythe>And these are the four asset classes that have just gone through and how they've behaved in the last 15 years, OK.</v>

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:31.380
<v Jane Smythe>So when you invest, obviously anything that happens in the economy has an impact on the investments as well.</v>

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:34.300
<v Jane Smythe>So if we look at the cash line, which is a grey line.</v>

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:37.840
<v Jane Smythe>What do you see it doing over the last 15 years? Yeah, exactly.</v>

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.920
<v Jane Smythe>And the yellow line is inflation, so you can say.</v>

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:44.040
<v Jane Smythe>Is eating into it? Yeah.</v>

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:47.010
<v Jane Smythe>So yes, keeping everything in cash isn't a good idea.</v>

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:58.160
<v Jane Smythe>But like this money, if we invest in the right place, say 5-6 years time, you can start drawing it and do holidays if you wanted to do you know it's there to you've not got anything planned, but it's there if</v>

01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:58.700
<v Charlie Green>it keeps,</v>

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:01.300
<v Jane Smythe>yeah, and that's why it's work.</v>

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:05.600
<v Jane Smythe>It's a good idea to split it really in a way, isn't it? But then if we look at property.</v>

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:07.920
<v Jane Smythe>It's sort of didn't do anything.</v>

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:11.700
<v Jane Smythe>Started picking up in 2013 and that's beating inflation as well.</v>

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:14.960
<v Jane Smythe>It started dipping now, but it's beat inflation as well.</v>

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:15.800
<v Charlie Green>It has done.</v>

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:21.480
<v Charlie Green>But as you say, I can see everything is heading down, isn't it? Over the next few years that's gonna be the concern.</v>

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:22.770
<v Jane Smythe>Not for you.</v>

01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:23.760
<v Charlie Green>No, no,</v>

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:24.040
<v Charlie Green>no.</v>

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:27.470
<v Charlie Green>And go back up again potentially.</v>

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:33.760
<v Jane Smythe>If you were drawing out or you were drawing your pensions out or something like that, then yeah, maybe you need to think about it.</v>

01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:40.180
<v Jane Smythe>But if things are going down, I'm not saying they're not going down even further, but that's the right time potentially,</v>

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:41.380
<v Charlie Green>to start resting.</v>

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:44.180
<v Charlie Green>So yeah, you can either up high on them.</v>

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:45.490
<v Charlie Green>When it comes back.</v>

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.000
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, hopefully, hopefully.</v>

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:47.830
<v Jane Smythe>That's what I'm saying.</v>

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Charlie Green>But we don't know.</v>

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:49.240
<v Charlie Green>We don't know.</v>

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.510
<v Charlie Green>But</v>

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:50.720
<v Jane Smythe>obviously it's better than</v>

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:52.660
<v Charlie Green>exactly being at the top.</v>

01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:53.030
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.480
<v Jane Smythe>And then we've got the bonds.</v>

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.480
<v Jane Smythe>These are the gilts and corporate bonds that we were talking about.</v>

01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:58.940
<v Charlie Green>As well.</v>

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.810
<v Jane Smythe>And then we've got shares.</v>

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:04.400
<v Charlie Green>Yeah,</v>

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.000
<v Jane Smythe>cool.</v>

01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:06.180
<v Charlie Green>And obviously</v>

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:09.900
<v Jane Smythe>they're all in the investment market and obviously they all fluctuate in the stock market.</v>

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:14.070
<v Jane Smythe>The reasons they've obviously gone up and down in 2008.</v>

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:21.610
<v Jane Smythe>The stock market and the property market did because the Bank of England reduce its interest rates to nought .5 bond market growth.</v>

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:25.130
<v Jane Smythe>Then we had the referendum in 2016 again.</v>

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.220
<v Jane Smythe>At that time, to be honest,</v>

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.320
<v Charlie Green>both regroup, yeah,</v>

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.950
<v Charlie Green>because everybody thought the world was gonna end.</v>

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.310
<v Jane Smythe>But the stock market did the opposite.</v>

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.690
<v Jane Smythe>Then COVID.</v>

01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:42.700
<v Jane Smythe>Bond market carried on a property market did a U-turn, stock market went down, but then it picked up again by the end of 2021.</v>

01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:51.130
<v Jane Smythe>But then we had Ukraine which obviously the stock market still carried on but the bond market started coming down and then the mini budget which has the work.</v>

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:54.050
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah,</v>

01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:55.480
<v Charlie Green>yeah, exactly.</v>

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:55.860
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:56.390
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:59.500
<v Jane Smythe>But what is trying to show you here is that by spreading it</v>

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:02.100
<v Charlie Green>and over time it will as you can see.</v>

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:03.750
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.040
<v Jane Smythe>The path to investing.</v>

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:13.780
<v Jane Smythe>So when considering investing your money, it's it's good to run through a few cheques to make sure it's suitable solution and the right time for you.</v>

01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:15.260
<v Jane Smythe>Deal with that.</v>

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.960
<v Jane Smythe>You haven't got any.</v>

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:17.100
<v Jane Smythe>Yep, be prepared.</v>

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:25.050
<v Jane Smythe>When investing, make sure you have enough cash put to one side to deal with unexpected emergency or planned spending, which we have done, and set an investment goal.</v>

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:29.990
<v Jane Smythe>Know what you want to achieve from your investment so you can take on the right level of investment risk.</v>

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:33.170
<v Jane Smythe>Are you investing for a specific purpose? Well, you're not really.</v>

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:34.680
<v Jane Smythe>You just want us to grow for yourself.</v>

01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.840
<v Jane Smythe>Will you want to use this as an income in the future?</v>

01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:46.800
<v Charlie Green>Potentially not or potentially not, but I think I'm again it might be looking at inheritance, HM planning at that point, yeah.</v>

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.720
<v Jane Smythe>Or you may take it</v>

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:48.860
<v Charlie Green>out to holidays or</v>

01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:50.420
<v Jane Smythe>bits and bobs that you may want to do.</v>

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:52.500
<v Jane Smythe>So not an income but just to grow.</v>

01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:59.180
<v Jane Smythe>So obviously if you did a holiday for 5000 now in 5-6 years time that I'm gonna be the same holiday exactly.</v>

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:05.120
<v Jane Smythe>So keeping up with that maybe that's might might be using it for four years time because you're gonna get a state pension.</v>

01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:05.620
<v Jane Smythe>I don't</v>

01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:07.250
<v Charlie Green>think you're really on this morning.</v>

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:08.610
<v Charlie Green>As an income,</v>

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:09.790
<v Jane Smythe>but maybe to</v>

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.230
<v Charlie Green>dip into as and when you want to</v>

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.610
<v Jane Smythe>or you know, leave it invested just to read out as and when you want to</v>

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.430
<v Charlie Green>or exactly</v>

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:18.470
<v Charlie Green>fact.</v>

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:27.880
<v Charlie Green>Thinking about it, am I doing it the right way round? Because the next four years they're probably gonna be the toughest years that I'll have until the state pension comes in.</v>

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.170
<v Charlie Green>But I'm thinking I've managed to sort of for four years on that and savings up to date.</v>

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.650
<v Charlie Green>And then if I have those pots of money, I think my big expenditure will have gone out this year.</v>

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:41.100
<v Charlie Green>So yeah, I mean, it should be alright.</v>

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:43.560
<v Charlie Green>If I can do that, then yeah, should be fine.</v>

01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:44.400
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:48.010
<v Charlie Green>It's nice to go through this because you think as well, doesn't it? Yeah.</v>

01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:48.680
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.810
<v Jane Smythe>Are you invest, looking to invest? Look, you are.</v>

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:54.770
<v Jane Smythe>And there's not enough to actually do a regular amount as you, as you can see.</v>

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:57.840
<v Jane Smythe>Be comfortable with uncertainty.</v>

01:05:57.850 --> 01:06:05.520
<v Jane Smythe>So as your investment is linked to the success of certain shares, bonds, property, there will be times when you see this value drop.</v>

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:11.730
<v Jane Smythe>Keeping focused on your goal and time to invest rather than the short term shifts will help you avoid making impulsive decisions.</v>

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:17.020
<v Jane Smythe>So when we say five years, the recommendation doesn't mean that you can't get access to your money.</v>

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.380
<v Jane Smythe>I don't want you to be drawn in this money out when he's gone down.</v>

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.100
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:25.050
<v Jane Smythe>And that's why there's enough in your cash in emergency funds that you can leave this share.</v>

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.610
<v Jane Smythe>This is Money that you want it to grow for you.</v>

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:28.450
<v Charlie Green>Mm-hmm.</v>

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.530
<v Charlie Green>Doesn't make sense.</v>

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:29.870
<v Charlie Green>No, it</v>

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.100
<v Jane Smythe>does.</v>

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:30.400
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:30.910
<v Jane Smythe>So we don't.</v>

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.650
<v Jane Smythe>I don't want you to.</v>

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:35.670
<v Jane Smythe>If it's made money and you want to draw it out, there's no charges for it.</v>

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:36.620
<v Jane Smythe>Sure, it's just.</v>

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.310
<v Jane Smythe>If it's not, that's why we all say five years.</v>

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.330
<v Jane Smythe>So you know this is a long term investment.</v>

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:42.600
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah,</v>

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.320
<v Charlie Green>yeah,</v>

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:44.750
<v Jane Smythe>spreading your investment.</v>

01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:50.160
<v Jane Smythe>So spreading your investment means go, means you aren't placing all your investment eggs in one basket.</v>

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:51.540
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.040
<v Jane Smythe>But this enables greater asset diversification.</v>

01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:57.200
<v Jane Smythe>So that dips in some areas may be compensated by increases and others.</v>

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.150
<v Jane Smythe>Time in the market of effect phrase time in the market emphasises the importance of sustaining invested for the long term.</v>

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.480
<v Jane Smythe>It's advisable to review your investment on a regular basis to ensure you keep your goal and track.</v>

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:16.090
<v Jane Smythe>And making investments not purely just considering the level of risk, we'll go through everything and have that conversation.</v>

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:21.560
<v Jane Smythe>And like I said, you know there's different management styles as well, which I'll explain to you a little bit further down.</v>

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:28.360
<v Jane Smythe>So talking about diversification, so if you investing in 90,000 and you're investing in a medium risk, this is just an example.</v>

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:39.090
<v Jane Smythe>Medium risk with Mango Bank, how would it be diversified? So you'd have 7% in cash, 33% in bonds, nothing in property and 60% in shares.</v>

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.130
<v Jane Smythe>And this is what you were taught</v>

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.910
<v Charlie Green>high you were talking about,</v>

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:48.680
<v Jane Smythe>but it's further diversified? And it's in 78 countries.</v>

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:50.720
<v Jane Smythe>1025 companies.</v>

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:53.980
<v Jane Smythe>So when I said we're restricted, yeah.</v>

01:07:55.610 --> 01:08:02.780
<v Charlie Green>Is this all on being risk adverse or is this on this is on a medium risk, medium one? Yeah, OK,</v>

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:03.990
<v Jane Smythe>this is an example of.</v>

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.870
<v Charlie Green>Obviously your risk</v>

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.660
<v Jane Smythe>would depend on once we've gone through the risk.</v>

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:11.330
<v Jane Smythe>Questions and your personality and behaviour of the risk.</v>

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:16.450
<v Jane Smythe>But it just means just by having an open mind on looking at what options are out there.</v>

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.270
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, yeah, the level of risk</v>

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.750
<v Charlie Green>is what you want at the end of the day, which is what we're work on.</v>

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.950
<v Charlie Green>But this is on a medium risk</v>

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.670
<v Jane Smythe>example of a medium risk, but it just shows you that it's not just.</v>

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.820
<v Jane Smythe>Spread out in the classic classes, countries and continents</v>

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:31.920
<v Charlie Green>where you and I wouldn't even know exactly.</v>

01:08:32.230 --> 01:08:32.870
<v Charlie Green>You're right.</v>

01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:33.900
<v Charlie Green>No, absolutely.</v>

01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:38.830
<v Jane Smythe>And that's why I say when they take, it's like if you bet on a horse that there's no calculated risk.</v>

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.340
<v Charlie Green>It's only one</v>

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.970
<v Jane Smythe>here.</v>

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:44.100
<v Jane Smythe>You've got professionals and managing it, knowing what's happening.</v>

01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:45.430
<v Jane Smythe>They're doing it for you.</v>

01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:46.190
<v Jane Smythe>Mm-hmm.</v>

01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:47.490
<v Jane Smythe>And you would expect.</v>

01:08:48.150 --> 01:08:50.500
<v Jane Smythe>HM those fund managers to do the job</v>

01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:51.130
<v Charlie Green>for you.</v>

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:52.220
<v Charlie Green>Exactly.</v>

01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:54.800
<v Charlie Green>And that's why that W that's what worries me.</v>

01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:55.620
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, I mean,</v>

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:58.760
<v Jane Smythe>I'll show you when I do go through a presentation next week.</v>

01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:04.850
<v Jane Smythe>We have one the money manufacture awards for being the best stocks and shares ISA providers.</v>

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:05.990
<v Charlie Green>2nd.</v>

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.730
<v Charlie Green>Hopefully reassuring, yeah.</v>

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:10.540
<v Jane Smythe>Just gives you that little bit of reassurance</v>

01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:11.100
<v Charlie Green>as well.</v>

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:23.140
<v Jane Smythe>I mean obviously if there's markets are going down, they're gonna see your funds go down as well, but realistically now you should know anyway because you will get statements, but you'll know daily what it's worth, yeah.</v>

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:28.470
<v Charlie Green>And hopefully, but as you say, we're coming to the bottom of it, it should bounce back up.</v>

01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:29.120
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah,</v>

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.970
<v Charlie Green>hopefully, we don't know next year, but yeah.</v>

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.790
<v Jane Smythe>Balancing risk with the benefits of investing.</v>

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Jane Smythe>So there's all kinds of risks when you invest.</v>

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.110
<v Jane Smythe>I'm just gonna go through a few inflation risks we've gone through.</v>

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:41.970
<v Jane Smythe>Liquidity risk is basically if you own a fixed.</v>

01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:47.150
<v Jane Smythe>Bond or a fixed term investment? You can't get access to it.</v>

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.210
<v Jane Smythe>That's liquidity risk.</v>

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.150
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.700
<v Jane Smythe>Investment risk, you're going into the investment market, so you will see money going up and down.</v>

01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:58.350
<v Jane Smythe>There is that element of risk, that fluctuation, volatility, sure.</v>

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:05.290
<v Jane Smythe>HM, Yeah, do you understand that? And currency risk, your money will be invested abroad, so bringing it back into the UK, the conversion rate.</v>

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.140
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.510
<v Jane Smythe>Because even if it's in cash, there's still that risk, isn't there?</v>

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:11.420
<v Charlie Green>Hmm.</v>

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.650
<v Jane Smythe>There's all kinds of risks, isn't there? And then.</v>

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:19.420
<v Charlie Green>Say it's just, it's just hoping that they get the balance of it right somehow.</v>

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.430
<v Charlie Green>And it</v>

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:24.780
<v Jane Smythe>it depends on the risk you're comfortable with, depends on how they diversify for you as well.</v>

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:25.400
<v Jane Smythe>Sure.</v>

01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:31.100
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, obviously a higher risk, you're gonna get a higher return maybe, but you stand to lose more as well.</v>

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.260
<v Jane Smythe>HM deposits, so this is protection obviously under the deposit</v>

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:38.540
<v Charlie Green>umbrella it's 85,000,</v>

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:41.640
<v Jane Smythe>Investments, like I said, come under a different umbrella,</v>

01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:42.310
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:44.140
<v Jane Smythe>Once I know what you're gonna do, I'll explain</v>

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:50.940
<v Charlie Green>that to you more than is that another 85,000? So that would be about right because we say there's 92.</v>

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.040
<v Charlie Green>So basically</v>

01:10:52.250 --> 01:11:02.810
<v Jane Smythe>if you think about if you're investing in shares, bonds and whatever shares, bonds, it's an A portfolio, it's it's invested, but it's not understand and it doesn't come under Mango Bank.</v>

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:03.480
<v Jane Smythe>Balance sheet.</v>

01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:06.290
<v Jane Smythe>So Mango Bank were to go insolvent, the investment would carry on,</v>

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.590
<v Charlie Green>that's right.</v>

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.610
<v Charlie Green>But what about the difference, the 5000 difference? What it is, is the</v>

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:21.670
<v Jane Smythe>fact that if Mango Bank were to go insolvent, yes, and you felt you were miss, sold, misrepresented, other fund managers weren't doing what they needed to do, then you there's a rise to claim up to 85,000.</v>

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:22.860
<v Charlie Green>But realistically</v>

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:24.930
<v Jane Smythe>if you think about it the way it's invested.</v>

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:26.700
<v Jane Smythe>And carry on anyway.</v>

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:27.720
<v Jane Smythe>It'll be held with a third.</v>

01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:37.300
<v Jane Smythe>If Mango Bank were to go insolvent, what would happen then would be if they kinda, if they're looking at if my fund manager and looking after it, if they became insolvent and we're no longer there, what would</v>

01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:40.640
<v Jane Smythe>happen held by third party, it's still carry on.</v>

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:43.360
<v Jane Smythe>If that third party went, there'll be another party</v>

01:11:43.570 --> 01:11:44.600
<v Charlie Green>so that what happens.</v>

01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:49.100
<v Charlie Green>So to with that third party you don't have any control over their charges.</v>

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:50.710
<v Charlie Green>No, no, no, no, no, no, nothing like that</v>

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:50.940
<v Jane Smythe>so.</v>

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.120
<v Jane Smythe>The charges and everything</v>

01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:53.930
<v Charlie Green>the fund managers</v>

01:11:53.940 --> 01:12:01.270
<v Jane Smythe>will charge you, which are going through, yes, but what I'm trying to explain, the money that you're investing in shares, bonds, your owner of those shares and bonds.</v>

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.010
<v Jane Smythe>So it doesn't come under Mango Bank's balance sheet.</v>

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.070
<v Jane Smythe>So it's invested in companies and separately.</v>

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.820
<v Jane Smythe>So Mango Bank were to go and solve them.</v>

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:10.330
<v Jane Smythe>That'd be best, will carry on,</v>

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.050
<v Charlie Green>right? Does that make sense? It kind of does.</v>

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:17.630
<v Charlie Green>But what do? Why do they say then that they'll they'll cover up to 85,000</v>

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.740
<v Jane Smythe>if Mango Bank did go insolvent? Yes.</v>

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.310
<v Jane Smythe>And you felt that I didn't give you the right advice.</v>

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:29.470
<v Jane Smythe>HM the fund managers weren't doing what they needed to do, then you could have a right to claim up to 85.</v>

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:30.390
<v Jane Smythe>I'll give you an example.</v>

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.780
<v Jane Smythe>I had a customer many, many years ago who was advised by independent financial adviser to invest</v>

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:36.870
<v Charlie Green>this amount of funds.</v>

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.520
<v Jane Smythe>Not independent financial adviser was gaoled for misselling.</v>

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:48.170
<v Jane Smythe>And she claimed on the FCA and she got at that time was up to 50,000.</v>

01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:51.800
<v Jane Smythe>She got 50,000 because she had invested whatever she invested.</v>

01:12:51.970 --> 01:12:54.260
<v Jane Smythe>But that's the kind of coverage you have, right.</v>

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.910
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:56.410
<v Jane Smythe>Does that make sense? Yeah.</v>

01:12:56.450 --> 01:13:03.140
<v Jane Smythe>But you're only investment because the money that you're investing is in shares and bonds is not an at the minute your money's understand under.</v>

01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:03.580
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:07.720
<v Jane Smythe>Balance it's of Mango Bank, It's under the, of course, up to 85.</v>

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:10.850
<v Jane Smythe>But if invested, it's out of Mango Bank's balance sheet.</v>

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:11.500
<v Jane Smythe>Yes.</v>

01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:16.720
<v Jane Smythe>Obviously your owner of that shares those bonds, you're it's an investment.</v>

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.890
<v Charlie Green>OK, Yeah, yeah, no problem.</v>

01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:27.450
<v Charlie Green>How easy would that be to at the end of, I presume if you've we would put a term on it, so say five years would be the minimum.</v>

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:39.570
<v Charlie Green>I'm presuming is what you'd be looking at at the end of that then maybe to start looking at inheritance planning then would that make sense? Entirely up to you because obviously this money is gonna grow as well for you.</v>

01:13:39.610 --> 01:13:40.850
<v Charlie Green>Exactly HM.</v>

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.630
<v Charlie Green>So it would be right to wait till the either.</v>

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:48.320
<v Charlie Green>Before we start or at the end of the term, it's entirely doing it,</v>

01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:50.120
<v Jane Smythe>OK, but obviously I can't</v>

01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:55.840
<v Charlie Green>give you inheritance advice, so that's why you need to weigh up whether you want me to do it for you or you wanna take inheritance</v>

01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:56.760
<v Jane Smythe>advice first.</v>

01:13:57.110 --> 01:14:02.000
<v Jane Smythe>So you just need to weigh that up, OK, before we go through the recommendations and obviously you need to</v>

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:02.350
<v Charlie Green>see what</v>

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.740
<v Jane Smythe>I mean.</v>

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:07.590
<v Jane Smythe>You are quite young, but there is an inheritance liability there, so.</v>

01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:09.380
<v Charlie Green>It is, yeah.</v>

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:17.120
<v Charlie Green>That's definitely something I need to give a lot of thought to now and maybe speak to somebody about to find out what they recommend.</v>

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:24.920
<v Charlie Green>HM But I mean, whatever happens, I'm really need to invest regardless because if it just sits there, it's gonna lose anyway.</v>

01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:26.370
<v Charlie Green>So yes,</v>

01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:29.240
<v Jane Smythe>yeah, I mean, I won't be able to see you next week anyway.</v>

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:30.460
<v Jane Smythe>So you'll be in the new year,</v>

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:31.090
<v Charlie Green>so you might have</v>

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.660
<v Jane Smythe>a chance to speak to somebody and I can sort of, we can speak and</v>

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.380
<v Charlie Green>sure.</v>

01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:47.810
<v Charlie Green>In the interim, I'm just wondering should I move some of that to and open another account elsewhere just while the money is physically sitting there? HM because it is only 85,000 that's guaranteed at the moment, you can do.</v>

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:48.460
<v Charlie Green>We want to</v>

01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:51.240
<v Jane Smythe>but if you look back have any banks will be inside is gone.</v>

01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:56.090
<v Charlie Green>Ohh, I know, but it's just you know if you feel quite had so much portable.</v>

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.380
<v Charlie Green>Yes you can if that and then bring it back.</v>

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:03.080
<v Charlie Green>I mean it would be quite easy to just close the accounts or whatever even if they were current accounts.</v>

01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:09.440
<v Charlie Green>I'm not expecting them to own me very much but just so that the money makes you feel better, you can do but the reassurance would be there hasn't</v>

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:10.410
<v Jane Smythe>been any banks</v>

01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Charlie Green>it depends on how you feel.</v>

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:16.860
<v Charlie Green>OK Is my current account the best place for it until we meet again.</v>

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:18.420
<v Charlie Green>So I'll just have a look.</v>

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.190
<v Jane Smythe>Might be worth just moving into a savings account, which you have got if you're not.</v>

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:26.930
<v Charlie Green>I do.</v>

01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:27.470
<v Charlie Green>No, that's</v>

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.170
<v Jane Smythe>Mum's account, isn't it? Yeah, no, the ISA wouldn't.</v>

01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:33.130
<v Jane Smythe>So you could actually you do online, don't you?</v>

01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:33.830
<v Charlie Green>I do.</v>

01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:39.220
<v Jane Smythe>So open a savings account online, just transfer funds over from the current account to the savings account.</v>

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:40.900
<v Charlie Green>That's Mum's account is, yes.</v>

01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:42.240
<v Charlie Green>So you need to keep that separate.</v>

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:44.340
<v Charlie Green>Well, I want to close that one down eventually.</v>

01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:46.680
<v Jane Smythe>There's an you saver online.</v>

01:15:46.870 --> 01:16:00.670
<v Jane Smythe>OK, it's an instant access account, but it takes obviously you could transfer up to 200,000 or less than because you get HM one 1.75% up to 20,000, so 198,000 something.</v>

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:04.180
<v Charlie Green>To think about because I I just think current account is probably no.</v>

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:06.130
<v Jane Smythe>So that way it keeps it separate.</v>

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:09.350
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, but then it's not showing on your current account when you're using current account.</v>

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.490
<v Jane Smythe>Then if you wanna go ahead and do, I can just take it out of that can't anyway.</v>

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.590
<v Charlie Green>Yeah,</v>

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:15.690
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.550
<v Charlie Green>I'll think about that one tonight as well.</v>

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.480
<v Charlie Green>If I can then yeah, just go online.</v>

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.310
<v Jane Smythe>It's simple.</v>

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.830
<v Jane Smythe>Just open anything for account and this transfer funds.</v>

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.260
<v Jane Smythe>It's an instant access account HM and it just keeps it away, doesn't it?</v>

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:29.940
<v Charlie Green>It does.</v>

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:30.520
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.940
<v Jane Smythe>Isn't Everyday Saver account on there as well? So you can choose, but that one doesn't pay, the other one pays a little bit more so you</v>

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:38.280
<v Charlie Green>can choose which one you want to.</v>

01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:38.860
<v Charlie Green>We do that.</v>

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:39.340
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:40.240
<v Charlie Green>No, that sounds good.</v>

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:41.000
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, thank you.</v>

01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:44.410
<v Jane Smythe>But it just keeps it away from the current account, doesn't it?</v>

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.410
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.160
<v Jane Smythe>And then.</v>

01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:51.760
<v Jane Smythe>The only thing I'm gonna talk to you about here is the active and the passive investments.</v>

01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:53.620
<v Jane Smythe>So this is the management style.</v>

01:16:53.630 --> 01:17:00.920
<v Jane Smythe>So active investment management is where the fund manager makes active investment decisions based on their view of the potential for capital growth.</v>

01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:08.690
<v Jane Smythe>So they active fund manager, he goes into the markets itself and buys those funds, then they actively manage it.</v>

01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:16.290
<v Jane Smythe>It's a hands on approach, the try and beat the index to give you that greater growth potential because it actively managed ongoingly.</v>

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.360
<v Jane Smythe>OK, the charge is a little bit higher.</v>

01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:26.570
<v Jane Smythe>Just Gonna say now, passive investment management style is where the funds performance aims to mirror track that other market index.</v>

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:30.360
<v Jane Smythe>So with a passive fund, the fund managers buy other funds.</v>

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:31.510
<v Charlie Green>Bye,</v>

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.790
<v Jane Smythe>Shroder MG those are just examples.</v>

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:45.110
<v Jane Smythe>They go into those funds, sure they don't have a hands on approach and they sort of mirror and index like FTSE 100 index because they have not got the hands on approach.</v>

01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:47.950
<v Jane Smythe>They'll still grow, but they're the charges a bit less.</v>

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.410
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.380
<v Jane Smythe>So it depends on what you prefer.</v>

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:50.850
<v Jane Smythe>Do you</v>

01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:57.870
<v Charlie Green>do you think they balance each other out or in terms of fee versus the extra income</v>

01:17:57.910 --> 01:18:01.090
<v Jane Smythe>you pay you, you get what you pay for, isn't it?</v>

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.730
<v Charlie Green>If they do you is the thing.</v>

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:10.670
<v Charlie Green>I mean it it it it we worth paying the slightly extra if you know that the income is gonna be higher anyway,</v>

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.310
<v Jane Smythe>potentially what they're trying to do, they're trying to get you that greater growth potential.</v>

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.540
<v Jane Smythe>So if you're after that greater growth potential,</v>

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.370
<v Charlie Green>you might as well pay the extra.</v>

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:23.690
<v Charlie Green>But it doesn't guarantee in which case like last time, I could end up being the wrong side of it.</v>

01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:24.210
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:27.820
<v Jane Smythe>But then again you can review in a few years and see what yeah options.</v>

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.890
<v Charlie Green>And see what you risk</v>

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:31.780
<v Jane Smythe>at that time was.</v>

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:32.230
<v Jane Smythe>So it's</v>

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.050
<v Charlie Green>yeah, it's a choice that you could, it's good to know the options</v>

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.070
<v Jane Smythe>exactly.</v>

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:37.730
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.570
<v Jane Smythe>So let's go back</v>

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:40.750
<v Charlie Green>to.</v>

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.290
<v Jane Smythe>That's fine.</v>

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:49.260
<v Jane Smythe>So now what we're gonna do is gonna go through the rest of the risk profiling, So bear with me a second.</v>

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:51.820
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.630
<v Jane Smythe>So here what I'm gonna do is I'm now we're gonna obviously establish your risk profile, OK.</v>

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:07.410
<v Jane Smythe>And and this is a sort of a broad holistic approach to capturing basically your risk personality.</v>

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:09.000
<v Charlie Green>HM</v>

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.020
<v Jane Smythe>And you shouldn't think too much into it.</v>

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:12.100
<v Jane Smythe>Really, it's just.</v>

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.790
<v Jane Smythe>Overthink.</v>

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.050
<v Jane Smythe>The response is there's it's three activities that you're gonna go through.</v>

01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:19.060
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, there's no right or wrong answers.</v>

01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:24.790
<v Jane Smythe>The results just help to establish, ER, more of an accurate understanding of your.</v>

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.230
<v Jane Smythe>Miss Personality.</v>

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:27.650
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:27.990
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.170
<v Jane Smythe>You OK with that? And then it helps me to sort of provide the best solution for you.</v>

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.970
<v Jane Smythe>So you're gonna take them out in a bit and you're gonna do it yourself.</v>

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:40.670
<v Jane Smythe>So first of all, let me just go through this with you, OK.</v>

01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:43.630
<v Jane Smythe>So there's three activities, risk, future, and loss.</v>

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.370
<v Jane Smythe>And we'll focus on this.</v>

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.070
<v Jane Smythe>So the risk one's the first one.</v>

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:48.890
<v Jane Smythe>It's less talk about risk.</v>

01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:55.430
<v Jane Smythe>We wish we could tell you that investing is a sure fire way to make money out of out.</v>

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:55.860
<v Jane Smythe>Of course.</v>

01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:56.330
<v Jane Smythe>You can't.</v>

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.070
<v Jane Smythe>You know that.</v>

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:57.620
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:03.670
<v Jane Smythe>Although investing of the long term may reduce the risk, it is always possible you will lose some money on your investments,</v>

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:04.220
<v Charlie Green>yeah.</v>

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:10.550
<v Jane Smythe>And the following ten statements aim to Gorgeous feeling towards risk.</v>

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.090
<v Jane Smythe>There are no right or wrong answers.</v>

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:16.590
<v Jane Smythe>Choose honestly and we'll be able to recommend the investment you feel most comfortable with.</v>

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:17.490
<v Charlie Green>OK, there you go.</v>

01:20:17.530 --> 01:20:17.950
<v Charlie Green>All right.</v>

01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.540
<v Charlie Green>HM.</v>

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.340
<v Charlie Green>No, these are it's tricky ones because yeah.</v>

01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:39.200
<v Charlie Green>And Chance,</v>

01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:40.070
<v Charlie Green>yeah.</v>

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.210
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.200
<v Charlie Green>HM Yeah, go.</v>

01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.060
<v Charlie Green>Definitely.</v>

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:58.760
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.070
<v Charlie Green>Yes.</v>

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:09.650
<v Jane Smythe>Can do, but</v>

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.760
<v Charlie Green>it's fine if you don't take a few I suppose.</v>

01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:13.820
<v Charlie Green>So I'd say on that one.</v>

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:21.120
<v Charlie Green>You think so? Yeah.</v>

01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:32.310
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, no.</v>

01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:35.690
<v Charlie Green>If it if not, if it's the stupid one, then I'm certainly not</v>

01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:37.540
<v Jane Smythe>like that a lost one is there.</v>

01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:44.860
<v Jane Smythe>So it says investing in different is different from saving to potentially gain high returns, you accept the possibility of losing some of your money.</v>

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:49.980
<v Jane Smythe>This activity evaluates the amounts of gains versus losses you feel comfortable with, right?</v>

01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:52.910
<v Charlie Green>Land.</v>

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:57.950
<v Jane Smythe>Losing 10 but also 50% chance of gaining 80.</v>

01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:00.240
<v Charlie Green>How would you feel about it?</v>

01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:02.730
<v Jane Smythe>So that's that's when it's running,</v>

01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:03.580
<v Charlie Green>yeah.</v>

01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:10.260
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:26.410
<v Charlie Green>This is where it started.</v>

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.520
<v Charlie Green>That would be the last one.</v>

01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:28.780
<v Charlie Green>I would say no.</v>

01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:31.700
<v Charlie Green>No.</v>

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:36.720
<v Charlie Green>Definitely no.</v>

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:45.760
<v Charlie Green>8040 It's gone up again, isn't it? 5050 well.</v>

01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:47.900
<v Charlie Green>No point.</v>

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:51.180
<v Charlie Green>There's no way.</v>

01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:53.210
<v Charlie Green>No.</v>

01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:58.640
<v Charlie Green>How completely the other way? I can't believe it even put them in there.</v>

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.510
<v Jane Smythe>And the future?</v>

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.260
<v Jane Smythe>So this is investing is about the future.</v>

01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:12.320
<v Jane Smythe>Your choice of investment today will impact the money you could receive tomorrow.</v>

01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:15.090
<v Jane Smythe>This activity looks at how time affects your choice.</v>

01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.920
<v Charlie Green>I'd rather have.</v>

01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:22.700
<v Jane Smythe>HM.</v>

01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:31.310
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.010
<v Charlie Green>Louis, there you go.</v>

01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:35.950
<v Charlie Green>I thought it would be.</v>

01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:36.420
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Charlie Green>Would be, yeah.</v>

01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:40.680
<v Charlie Green>It kind of makes sense, I guess, at my age anyway.</v>

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.650
<v Jane Smythe>That just works it out for you, so.</v>

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.390
<v Jane Smythe>We have a boundary score.</v>

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.220
<v Charlie Green>Mm-hmm.</v>

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.210
<v Jane Smythe>Between 19 and 31.</v>

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:55.110
<v Jane Smythe>For a low risk, you're 28.49.</v>

01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:57.280
<v Charlie Green>What does that mean?</v>

01:23:57.590 --> 01:24:04.560
<v Jane Smythe>That means Big Bang right in the middle, isn't it really right? Yeah, 28, it's up to 31 is low risk would be.</v>

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.730
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:09.210
<v Jane Smythe>So you see, yeah, no, it's</v>

01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:10.140
<v Charlie Green>comfortable, right.</v>

01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:10.580
<v Charlie Green>Yes.</v>

01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:14.800
<v Charlie Green>Obviously returns on low risk.</v>

01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:18.160
<v Charlie Green>I understand it's gonna be a lot less than medium or high risk.</v>

01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.830
<v Charlie Green>So sorry, can I just say that's fine, I'm busy.</v>

01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:25.590
<v Jane Smythe>Vicky.</v>

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:28.430
<v Charlie Green>Good.</v>

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:28.760
<v Charlie Green>Thanks.</v>

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:31.000
<v Charlie Green>I've just in a meeting at the moment,</v>

01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:31.500
<v Jane Smythe>I'm</v>

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:33.940
<v Charlie Green>now is is no, no, no, it's all right.</v>

01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:34.780
<v Jane Smythe>Can I call you back</v>

01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:37.570
<v Charlie Green>shortly? OK.</v>

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.220
<v Charlie Green>No, don't worry.</v>

01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:38.780
<v Charlie Green>Thank you.</v>

01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:39.090
<v Charlie Green>Bye.</v>

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:44.090
<v Jane Smythe>Background.</v>

01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:49.320
<v Jane Smythe>04 and a half Ah.</v>

01:24:55.530 --> 01:24:56.650
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so let.</v>

01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:59.490
<v Charlie Green>Itself,</v>

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.150
<v Jane Smythe>right.</v>

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:08.310
<v Jane Smythe>So now what I'm going to do, I'm gonna go and we're gonna look at a forward-looking projection, what's called the investment return forecaster.</v>

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.320
<v Jane Smythe>Before we do that, I'm gonna go through three questions, which is what we talk about.</v>

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:13.760
<v Jane Smythe>Emotional.</v>

01:25:13.770 --> 01:25:19.490
<v Jane Smythe>If you lost this money, how would you deal with it? So it's gonna ask you three more questions on here, which I'm just gonna bring it up for you.</v>

01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:21.440
<v Jane Smythe>One second.</v>

01:25:31.170 --> 01:25:32.480
<v Jane Smythe>In one place, by mind.</v>

01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:47.840
<v Jane Smythe>So we're allocating 92,000, that's 90,000, sorry, that's what we're looking at.</v>

01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.630
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so we calculate the capacity for loss questions like I said, emotionally how you feel.</v>

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.530
<v Jane Smythe>So the question, first question.</v>

01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:15.460
<v Charlie Green>Let's see the value of it full also.</v>

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.590
<v Charlie Green>Would you keep your money invested or? Yes, I probably probably would.</v>

01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:23.270
<v Jane Smythe>And why would you keep it invested?</v>

01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.330
<v Charlie Green>It maybe just depends.</v>

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.420
<v Charlie Green>Hoping it was a bad time and it would have time to recover.</v>

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.510
<v Jane Smythe>Give it time to recover, yeah.</v>

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:39.290
<v Jane Smythe>Question 2.</v>

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:40.710
<v Jane Smythe>HM.</v>

01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:47.070
<v Charlie Green>Yes, the same thing again.</v>

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.640
<v Charlie Green>I think I would use other money.</v>

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.600
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.270
<v Charlie Green>Last one.</v>

01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:54.940
<v Charlie Green>Just in the future, yeah.</v>

01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:56.340
<v Charlie Green>Last one, yeah.</v>

01:26:56.730 --> 01:26:57.820
<v Jane Smythe>And why is that? Because you've</v>

01:26:58.090 --> 01:27:05.820
<v Charlie Green>again because I, I hopefully I would have enough money and hopefully again give it time to recover, but there would be a time limit on that.</v>

01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:07.280
<v Charlie Green>Obviously it wouldn't be forever.</v>

01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.660
<v Jane Smythe>OK, no problem.</v>

01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:13.890
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:14.850
<v Jane Smythe>And the last one.</v>

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:18.670
<v Charlie Green>Probably moderately.</v>

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.240
<v Charlie Green>For later on, I would say</v>

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.330
<v Jane Smythe>moderately.</v>

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.720
<v Charlie Green>I'd managed BS, Yeah.</v>

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.430
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:27.310
<v Jane Smythe>So second one is moderately, Yeah.</v>

01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:28.280
<v Jane Smythe>And why is that</v>

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:36.970
<v Charlie Green>again? Because if the money failed, I'm thinking again on the inheritance side, because This is Money that I've put aside for my daughter.</v>

01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.340
<v Charlie Green>Really.</v>

01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:42.710
<v Charlie Green>HM And it would be her standard of living, rather than mine, that would be affected by it.</v>

01:27:47.050 --> 01:27:48.440
<v Jane Smythe>Not yours, that's what you're saying.</v>

01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:49.760
<v Jane Smythe>It wouldn't have an impact on,</v>

01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:52.340
<v Charlie Green>probably not on mine, but it would on.</v>

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.260
<v Jane Smythe>So it's going OK.</v>

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:59.330
<v Jane Smythe>So the money's obviously that you don't see having an impact on you from what you're saying.</v>

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.750
<v Jane Smythe>OK, no problem.</v>

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:02.910
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so.</v>

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:04.960
<v Jane Smythe>That was a high.</v>

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:08.730
<v Jane Smythe>So overall doesn't mean that it's changed it you still lower risk that's</v>

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.550
<v Charlie Green>you absorbing that loss.</v>

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.670
<v Jane Smythe>You've got quite a high.</v>

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.230
<v Charlie Green>Sure.</v>

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:12.790
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.270
<v Charlie Green>So</v>

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:17.110
<v Jane Smythe>let's just go through overall, you're still lower risk.</v>

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.510
<v Jane Smythe>So I'm gonna go through and just explain.</v>

01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:24.680
<v Jane Smythe>Mango Bank levels of investment risk, so lower risk, This is where you are.</v>

01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:25.690
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:32.230
<v Jane Smythe>So this is when you want to introduce a small portion of risk to aim for modest growth over your time to invest.</v>

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.110
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, lower risk investments are pro predominantly in bonds,</v>

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:37.310
<v Charlie Green>which</v>

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:39.410
<v Jane Smythe>is what you were saying anyway, isn't it? Yeah.</v>

01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:43.810
<v Jane Smythe>Although they can include some shares as well as small portion in cash.</v>

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.510
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, that kinda makes sense.</v>

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.510
<v Charlie Green>Does that make sense? Yeah.</v>

01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:49.860
<v Charlie Green>Does that feel it feels probably where I was looking to go anyway.</v>

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:50.500
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:52.530
<v Charlie Green>OK, so you're comfortable with that? Yeah.</v>

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.590
<v Charlie Green>OK, no problem.</v>

01:28:54.740 --> 01:29:00.760
<v Jane Smythe>OK, so now what? We're gonna look now we're gonna obviously, like I said, we're gonna look at a forward-looking projection, OK.</v>

01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:11.210
<v Jane Smythe>There's no right or wrong answers, OK? And we're gonna use the lower risk because that's what you've come out as and what it's gonna analyse is the most likely return, the high return and the lowest turn.</v>

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:20.800
<v Jane Smythe>And like I said, it's just a prediction and it's not designed by Mango Bank, It's been designed by Moodys who use analytical and plotted.</v>

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.500
<v Jane Smythe>On a graph to give you the most likely return, the high return.</v>

01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:31.680
<v Jane Smythe>And now the beauty of this is it doesn't include the advisory service because you pay that separately, but it includes the ongoing charge for the management of the fund.</v>

01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:35.240
<v Jane Smythe>And there's a platform fee that includes all the charges in there, right.</v>

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.100
<v Jane Smythe>OK, Yeah.</v>

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:36.900
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:38.250
<v Jane Smythe>So let's have a look at this.</v>

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:48.640
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.030
<v Jane Smythe>Right.</v>

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:56.200
<v Jane Smythe>So like I said it's a generic, it's over a 10 year.</v>

01:29:56.210 --> 01:29:58.370
<v Jane Smythe>Because it says there's no time scale is there.</v>

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:02.730
<v Jane Smythe>Now it looks at real times term terms or nominal terms.</v>

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:08.790
<v Jane Smythe>Now real terms means includes inflation and nominal terms it doesn't include.</v>

01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:12.610
<v Jane Smythe>So with obviously you wanting to, I presume do you want</v>

01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.800
<v Charlie Green>including inflation? OK.</v>

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.690
<v Jane Smythe>Now then it says target lump sum.</v>

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:23.020
<v Jane Smythe>So do you have a target lump sum that you want this money to grow to or would you say? You want it to be at least 90,000.</v>

01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:26.460
<v Charlie Green>Well, at least 20,000.</v>

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:35.490
<v Charlie Green>HM Yes, I'm I'm trying to think what figure could reasonably put on it, but I would be upset if it came back out at 90,000.</v>

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:41.870
<v Charlie Green>Haven't paid their fees and obviously your fee as well, so probably to at least cover those costs.</v>

01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:45.120
<v Charlie Green>With this forecast will cover that.</v>

01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:46.620
<v Charlie Green>It will cover it, OK.</v>

01:30:46.630 --> 01:30:48.970
<v Charlie Green>So at least 90,000 then, yeah.</v>

01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:51.430
<v Charlie Green>OK,</v>

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:52.750
<v Jane Smythe>right.</v>

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.370
<v Jane Smythe>So let me calculate that for you.</v>

01:30:54.380 --> 01:31:00.230
<v Jane Smythe>So what it's looking at here is the cash part, yes, so it's looking at cash.</v>

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:11.890
<v Jane Smythe>So what it's saying here, if you've invested the 90,000 in cash, there's 95% chance that you'd get more than 75,894 after 10 years.</v>

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.130
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:15.550
<v Jane Smythe>Including inflation because it's in cash, right.</v>

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.700
<v Charlie Green>OK, yeah.</v>

01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:21.770
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, it's included inflation, the 50% chance.</v>

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:27.480
<v Jane Smythe>It can be worth more than 97,422,</v>

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:28.450
<v Charlie Green>OK,</v>

01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:34.850
<v Jane Smythe>Then you've got 5% chance of it being worth more than 100 and 25156 pounds.</v>

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:35.400
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:39.070
<v Jane Smythe>So the target chance of that if it let if left in cash is 70%.</v>

01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.690
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:45.010
<v Jane Smythe>If we look at investing into the lower risk, OK, over the 10 year.</v>

01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:53.700
<v Jane Smythe>It's got 95% chance more than 72,257 bearing in mind it is in the stock market and that's why it gives you that figure.</v>

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:54.140
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:31:54.750 --> 01:32:00.700
<v Jane Smythe>But there's 50% chance that it could be worth more than 107,426</v>

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:02.290
<v Charlie Green>compared to 97.</v>

01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:07.380
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, I mean, the first figure is more worrying, I think than anything.</v>

01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:12.520
<v Charlie Green>I I know I said earlier on I'm not very good with it, but that's quite a chunk of money to lose.</v>

01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:17.020
<v Jane Smythe>But that's because we can't put and these are not guaranteed, they're just predictions.</v>

01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.720
<v Jane Smythe>Sure.</v>

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:21.200
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, now there's 5% chance more then</v>

01:32:21.490 --> 01:32:21.840
<v Charlie Green>yeah,</v>

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.560
<v Jane Smythe>156,005%</v>

01:32:24.570 --> 01:32:25.560
<v Charlie Green>is not very high.</v>

01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:31.130
<v Charlie Green>My books, I mean, it's a great figure 156, but in reality I'm thinking it's probably gonna go more.</v>

01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:36.380
<v Charlie Green>The other side, I'm more worried about 95%, which is virtually.</v>

01:32:38.190 --> 01:32:45.720
<v Charlie Green>What it's gonna be, there's only 50% chance it could be improved by quite a considerable projections, which</v>

01:32:45.730 --> 01:32:47.200
<v Jane Smythe>obviously they're not guaranteed.</v>

01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:50.420
<v Jane Smythe>I mean I can go back and show you past performance is not a guide to</v>

01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:51.200
<v Charlie Green>the future.</v>

01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:52.040
<v Charlie Green>But</v>

01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:55.600
<v Jane Smythe>again, this includes all charges and inflation, everything's included in this.</v>

01:32:55.710 --> 01:33:02.190
<v Charlie Green>But it is a bit worried, worrying to think that after 10 years it might drop from 90 to 75,000.</v>

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:02.630
<v Charlie Green>That's</v>

01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:05.500
<v Jane Smythe>basically because we don't know what might happen in the market.</v>

01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:07.890
<v Jane Smythe>It's giving you obviously 5%.</v>

01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:09.570
<v Jane Smythe>Part of what you could get, yeah.</v>

01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:15.210
<v Jane Smythe>And then a 5% chance of higher than higher and 50% of most likely kind of thing, if that makes sense</v>

01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:15.890
<v Charlie Green>to do this.</v>

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:16.280
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.670
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, So what the other thing.</v>

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:25.900
<v Charlie Green>I was gonna say for the 50% one to say that it might go up by 7000 / a ten year.</v>

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.960
<v Charlie Green>I would start to worry it could you not improve on that even elsewhere.</v>

01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:35.330
<v Jane Smythe>So this is not a Mango Bank product, just give you an example of a lower risk.</v>

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.630
<v Jane Smythe>This is why I said it's not been designed by Mango Bank.</v>

01:33:37.730 --> 01:33:40.480
<v Jane Smythe>They predict on a lower risk analyzer forward.</v>

01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:45.880
<v Jane Smythe>Look you know in the past used to say give you a blue sky scenario you're gonna do this and people never reach that.</v>

01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:49.350
<v Jane Smythe>So this is more of a realistic figure, but it's not guaranteed of course.</v>

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:56.450
<v Jane Smythe>Just gives you a forecaster of what potentially could happen, and as long as you're aware which you are, but it could be worth less,</v>

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:56.890
<v Charlie Green>you know.</v>

01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:59.120
<v Charlie Green>Sure.</v>

01:33:59.190 --> 01:34:04.640
<v Jane Smythe>We don't you don't want to do that but things which is under our control.</v>

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:07.040
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah happens and you're aware of that exactly</v>

01:34:07.170 --> 01:34:07.510
<v Charlie Green>yeah.</v>

01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:28.720
<v Jane Smythe>But what it also you haven't got obviously surplus funds but if you did have and if you wanted to beat the 78% and so for example we did 95 if you had the regular amount that you could put in yeah that 95% if you if you did want to if you had surplus funds, all you'd have to do is put another 217.77 in.</v>

01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:32.890
<v Jane Smythe>And that give you 90 / 95% chance.</v>

01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:35.540
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, but you haven't got that.</v>

01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:37.140
<v Jane Smythe>It was just an example.</v>

01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:37.600
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah,</v>

01:34:37.710 --> 01:34:38.430
<v Charlie Green>yeah.</v>

01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:43.970
<v Jane Smythe>But do you see what I'm trying to say? It's just the forecaster, but it gives you a forward-looking projection.</v>

01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:45.160
<v Charlie Green>Hmm.</v>

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:50.950
<v Charlie Green>This is, this is kind of what's making me nervous about Banana Bank is because I think that's kind of what happened.</v>

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.880
<v Charlie Green>But it ended up going after all that time into the end.</v>

01:34:54.070 --> 01:35:00.650
<v Jane Smythe>When I show you when I recommend, yeah, then I'll show you the fund it's going in, what potentially it should do.</v>

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:05.870
<v Jane Smythe>So do you see what I'm saying? This is just generic obviously lower risk investment.</v>

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:09.080
<v Jane Smythe>Then I'll go through and explain what the Mango Bank investment again.</v>

01:35:09.150 --> 01:35:10.530
<v Jane Smythe>It's not you can't.</v>

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.810
<v Charlie Green>I'll show you the ways be the element of risk past performance, I can't</v>

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:19.070
<v Jane Smythe>be guaranteed for the future, but it just gives you more of an understanding and that's why</v>

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.500
<v Charlie Green>you need to be honest the way things are at the moment.</v>

01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:29.310
<v Charlie Green>The past is not really reliable because there's so much recently happened that hasn't happened in the past that it's not giving you a fair.</v>

01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:36.760
<v Jane Smythe>That's why it's just being a I mean, obviously the way you're investing, you're trying to be inflation exactly</v>

01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:37.470
<v Charlie Green>with</v>

01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.750
<v Jane Smythe>investments and the way it's diversified.</v>

01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:45.810
<v Jane Smythe>Got more of a chance than leaving in cash, but you've got to take the element of risk, which is a low risk in your case, yeah.</v>

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.210
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:47.810
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:35:47.850 --> 01:35:48.490
<v Jane Smythe>Thank you.</v>

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.070
<v Jane Smythe>OK with that.</v>

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:49.950
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.130
<v Jane Smythe>Explain that in</v>

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:53.750
<v Charlie Green>you know you've done well.</v>

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.300
<v Charlie Green>OK, fine, that's OK.</v>

01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:56.710
<v Jane Smythe>Any questions? No.</v>

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.010
<v Jane Smythe>OK, no problem.</v>

01:35:59.000 --> 01:35:59.670
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.770
<v Jane Smythe>So that's it.</v>

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:01.440
<v Charlie Green>All right.</v>

01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:02.080
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:02.470
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.870
<v Jane Smythe>So I'll just ask a few more questions</v>

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:05.900
<v Charlie Green>and then we'll</v>

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:09.110
<v Jane Smythe>summarise and we'll come next meeting and then find out what you need to do.</v>

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:09.850
<v Charlie Green>So</v>

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:13.790
<v Jane Smythe>what's your understanding about risk? So when you take risk, what's your understanding?</v>

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.730
<v Charlie Green>HM For me, I'm not very comfortable with high risk.</v>

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.350
<v Charlie Green>I understand that there has to be an element of risk, but the smaller the risk, the better for me.</v>

01:36:29.170 --> 01:36:30.620
<v Jane Smythe>OK, So what I mean.</v>

01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:34.530
<v Charlie Green>HM.</v>

01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:43.230
<v Jane Smythe>Now when you say smaller, so you're happy with lower risk, lower risk,</v>

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.580
<v Charlie Green>yeah, sorry, lower risk.</v>

01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:46.680
<v Jane Smythe>So you're happy with lower, yeah.</v>

01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:48.710
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:51.490
<v Jane Smythe>Why do you want to take risk?</v>

01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:57.380
<v Charlie Green>Try and improve the the rate on it so it does keep up with inflation.</v>

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:00.490
<v Charlie Green>HM.</v>

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:01.590
<v Charlie Green>Morning.</v>

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:06.960
<v Jane Smythe>OK, Right.</v>

01:37:06.970 --> 01:37:09.420
<v Jane Smythe>So you said with Banana Bank, you saw it obviously going down.</v>

01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:11.440
<v Jane Smythe>You are gonna see fluctuations.</v>

01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:15.000
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, the nature of the game, isn't it Really.</v>

01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:20.850
<v Jane Smythe>So you're gonna see that if you do online banking, you're gonna see it everyday, but you do get quarterly statements.</v>

01:37:21.190 --> 01:37:24.180
<v Jane Smythe>How you gonna deal with that? Is it OK for you, Charlie? Yeah.</v>

01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:25.760
<v Jane Smythe>How you gonna deal with that, Charlie?</v>

01:37:26.170 --> 01:37:34.220
<v Charlie Green>Well, I will keep an eye on it and obviously I expect that there's gonna be a lot of times when it does, but I would want to see it picking up again.</v>

01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:38.610
<v Charlie Green>HM rather than we've Banana Bank, it just kept headed in one direction.</v>

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:44.980
<v Charlie Green>I mean I would certainly give it months maybe to improve to sort of see the improvement and up to a year maybe.</v>

01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:49.630
<v Charlie Green>But after that if there was still no improvement, I think I would start questioning it.</v>

01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:49.980
<v Charlie Green>Yeah,</v>

01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:53.990
<v Jane Smythe>so obviously if the markets doing well in, in your investments not doing well then.</v>

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:56.660
<v Jane Smythe>The market isn't doing well.</v>

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:56.960
<v Jane Smythe>And</v>

01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:57.870
<v Charlie Green>you know, there's something.</v>

01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:59.310
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.040
<v Charlie Green>And you're just waiting for the market to pick up and then watch.</v>

01:38:02.050 --> 01:38:03.560
<v Charlie Green>Hopefully that improves as well.</v>

01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:04.260
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:38:04.330 --> 01:38:08.720
<v Jane Smythe>So I think from what you're saying, obviously what's happened in the past, I can't speak about.</v>

01:38:08.730 --> 01:38:12.980
<v Jane Smythe>But yeah, HM, now you're investing for five years plus.</v>

01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:13.860
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:18.190
<v Jane Smythe>Now if you invested this money in six months time, you and I haven't got a crystal ball.</v>

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Jane Smythe>We don't know what's gonna happen.</v>

01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:21.040
<v Jane Smythe>And we have another stock market crash.</v>

01:38:21.130 --> 01:38:22.700
<v Jane Smythe>So everybody's funds are worth less.</v>

01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:24.780
<v Jane Smythe>Yours has gone down because there has been another.</v>

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.220
<v Jane Smythe>What do you do?</v>

01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:28.750
<v Charlie Green>Good question.</v>

01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:33.190
<v Charlie Green>I don't think I could take it out because if it's crashed, it's gonna have crashed everywhere.</v>

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.790
<v Charlie Green>So it will be similar to where we were a month or so ago where interest rates were low.</v>

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:40.290
<v Charlie Green>So I would have to try and just ride it out.</v>

01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:45.350
<v Charlie Green>Because they've got the chance for it to come back.</v>

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.010
<v Charlie Green>Exactly.</v>

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:49.840
<v Jane Smythe>Because if you do draw it out, you're gonna lose, gonna lose it anyway.</v>

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.260
<v Jane Smythe>And it's only been in for six months.</v>

01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:52.600
<v Jane Smythe>You've got those years to come back.</v>

01:38:52.610 --> 01:39:03.380
<v Jane Smythe>And that's why we always, when you see that graph, if you look at it, I know it's dipped right now, but over the longer term, over a five year term, potentially, that's why we always recommend five years.</v>

01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:04.310
<v Charlie Green>Exactly.</v>

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.730
<v Jane Smythe>And like I said, at the end of that, there's no term.</v>

01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:07.170
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:09.730
<v Jane Smythe>So if it's made money, you can take some of it out.</v>

01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:12.150
<v Jane Smythe>No, I don't want to the Tory when it's worth less.</v>

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.300
<v Charlie Green>I would want to do anyway.</v>

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:17.980
<v Jane Smythe>That's perfectly fine, no problem, OK.</v>

01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:20.430
<v Jane Smythe>That's summarise.</v>

01:39:21.130 --> 01:39:24.760
<v Jane Smythe>And you said you want active management anyway, didn't you? So I took that on board.</v>

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:27.120
<v Jane Smythe>You want the funds actively managed.</v>

01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:28.640
<v Jane Smythe>OK, No problem.</v>

01:39:28.890 --> 01:39:38.160
<v Jane Smythe>OK, So you're happy to invest for five years plus and 8090 thousand, OK in the lower risk, Yeah?</v>

01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.850
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:47.640
<v Jane Smythe>I'm not reviewing your shares that you've got with your company, so I do recommend you see if you want that reviewed.</v>

01:39:47.650 --> 01:39:49.000
<v Charlie Green>Sure I won't be reviewing them.</v>

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:52.880
<v Jane Smythe>Financial adviser? Yeah, planned expenditure.</v>

01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:57.440
<v Jane Smythe>So we've got 100K that you may give to your granddaughter.</v>

01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:01.720
<v Jane Smythe>HM10 for a car, yes.</v>

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.590
<v Jane Smythe>And</v>

01:40:02.630 --> 01:40:03.780
<v Charlie Green>pension? Yes</v>

01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:05.560
<v Jane Smythe>880.</v>

01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:07.350
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:08.970
<v Jane Smythe>There's no debts that you need to clear.</v>

01:40:09.490 --> 01:40:16.130
<v Jane Smythe>So the money that you're investing in, the 90,020 of it are wrapping this year's ISA.</v>

01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:18.030
<v Jane Smythe>OK, you've got.</v>

01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:20.740
<v Jane Smythe>Cash ISA as well.</v>

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:25.820
<v Jane Smythe>So I'd like to transfer that, yes, because that keeps it more tax efficient.</v>

01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:34.790
<v Jane Smythe>Doesn't it transfer 10,400? So 20 for this year transfer 10,400 previous years.</v>

01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:35.340
<v Jane Smythe>Mm-hmm.</v>

01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:35.940
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:40:36.650 --> 01:40:37.040
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:40:37.050 --> 01:40:41.680
<v Jane Smythe>What would you might be at the moment it's in the investment, the investment.</v>

01:40:41.690 --> 01:40:51.700
<v Jane Smythe>So what is the investment is spread out between shares and bonds, 90,000, but 30,400 will be in an ISA, OK.</v>

01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:52.690
<v Jane Smythe>It keeps it tax efficient.</v>

01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:58.280
<v Jane Smythe>So the more growth you make the more tax efficient it's the rest will be outside an ISA, OK.</v>

01:40:58.430 --> 01:41:06.940
<v Jane Smythe>But what I would say is from next April, I can automatically wrap it in ISA, yes, so fund managers will automatically and then that's a good idea.</v>

01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:10.510
<v Jane Smythe>By the time a few years gone, everything will be isa wrapped.</v>

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.630
<v Charlie Green>That'll be perfect.</v>

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.180
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.220
<v Charlie Green>HM.</v>

01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:22.550
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:24.400
<v Jane Smythe>You have got eyes to liability.</v>

01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:26.810
<v Jane Smythe>So what are your thoughts now we're talking about all this.</v>

01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:43.220
<v Charlie Green>Do you wanna take advice on take advice I think on that because that was quite a lot, wasn't it? We said at the end, so do you wanna do that first before that would see, I think that would make perfect sense, but I I like the idea of the way you've sort of planned things at the moment.</v>

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:51.640
<v Charlie Green>HM So I think once I've taken them on board as well, HM I I'll be able to definitely say we want to do so.</v>

01:41:51.650 --> 01:41:53.260
<v Charlie Green>I can't see you until.</v>

01:41:54.810 --> 01:41:56.010
<v Jane Smythe>Let's just have a look</v>

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:57.970
<v Charlie Green>and see if that gives you plenty</v>

01:41:57.980 --> 01:41:59.110
<v Jane Smythe>of time to get some.</v>

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:03.250
<v Charlie Green>Should I be doing any of that ISA wrapping at the moment?</v>

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.300
<v Jane Smythe>Because if you do it then I won't be able to access it.</v>

01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:08.310
<v Jane Smythe>Access it? So HM.</v>

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:09.650
<v Jane Smythe>Right.</v>

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:11.790
<v Jane Smythe>I can't see you in the first week.</v>

01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:12.270
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:42:13.630 --> 01:42:17.380
<v Jane Smythe>Second week, which is week commencing the 9th of January.</v>

01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:19.660
<v Jane Smythe>Do you think I'll give you enough time to go and see?</v>

01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:23.180
<v Charlie Green>I hope so.</v>

01:42:23.190 --> 01:42:25.300
<v Charlie Green>It's just as you say, we've Christmas coming now as</v>

01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.700
<v Jane Smythe>well.</v>

01:42:25.710 --> 01:42:25.970
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:30.710
<v Jane Smythe>I mean provisionally book it then what I'll do is I'll, we'll speak to each other if there's any difference you can.</v>

01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:31.400
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:39.080
<v Jane Smythe>So if we say, let's just quickly bring up calendar up for January, OK.</v>

01:42:39.090 --> 01:42:40.300
<v Charlie Green>So what sort of dates?</v>

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:45.280
<v Jane Smythe>Thinking potentially doing Wednesday the 11th, would that be OK? Yeah, lovely.</v>

01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:47.110
<v Jane Smythe>And I'm thinking roughly this time again.</v>

01:42:47.150 --> 01:42:48.430
<v Charlie Green>Yep, 2:00 PM.</v>

01:42:51.210 --> 01:42:52.110
<v Jane Smythe>Fantastic.</v>

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:57.030
<v Jane Smythe>But are they took that advice and then we can move forward giving you advice.</v>

01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.280
<v Jane Smythe>It's not sorted, you see.</v>

01:42:58.290 --> 01:42:59.130
<v Jane Smythe>That's lovely.</v>

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:03.770
<v Jane Smythe>So take that advice 1st and then you let me know how we're moving</v>

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.410
<v Charlie Green>forward, definitely.</v>

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.580
<v Jane Smythe>Like you said, you want you want to do something with</v>

01:43:10.590 --> 01:43:14.790
<v Charlie Green>this money anyway, don't need to because HM.</v>

01:43:16.150 --> 01:43:24.270
<v Charlie Green>I I don't know what else they'll recommend to to be able to pass it over, but I know there's, excuse me, the seven-year rule, but yeah.</v>

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.430
<v Charlie Green>Apart from that, I'm not quite sure what else I can do with it.</v>

01:43:28.630 --> 01:43:30.260
<v Jane Smythe>HM yeah.</v>

01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:32.120
<v Jane Smythe>So they'll get guide you through it.</v>

01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:39.200
<v Jane Smythe>There's there's various ways you can do things and you will give you that guidance on what you want to do and how you because I'm hoping this money's gonna grow for you.</v>

01:43:39.210 --> 01:43:40.340
<v Jane Smythe>So obviously again</v>

01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:41.400
<v Charlie Green>it's gonna</v>

01:43:41.410 --> 01:43:43.090
<v Jane Smythe>increase in your status and it's.</v>

01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:44.770
<v Jane Smythe>So let's take your card out.</v>

01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:45.780
<v Jane Smythe>Bear with me a second.</v>

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:46.280
<v Jane Smythe>Bear with me.</v>

01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:10.190
<v Jane Smythe>Thank you.</v>

01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:11.470
<v Charlie Green>You're welcome.</v>

01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:13.630
<v Charlie Green>Oh well, thank you for today.</v>

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:21.670
<v Charlie Green>It was it was the full 2 hours, wasn't it? I did say I hadn't realised it would really get to quite utter your card.</v>

01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:26.410
<v Charlie Green>To to that level but thank you very much.</v>

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:29.060
<v Jane Smythe>You don't realise it and think about it, isn't it?</v>

01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:36.520
<v Jane Smythe>When youm to be honest I think you need to as well because I think the options are there and gives you it makes you think as well.</v>

01:44:36.630 --> 01:44:37.060
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:46.600
<v Charlie Green>I think the problem is you see at home I've only been moved there two weeks and I still don't have an Internet and it's so frustrating because it's things like this when you're trying to look things up.</v>

01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:48.300
<v Charlie Green>I just haven't got anywhere to do that.</v>

01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:53.440
<v Jane Smythe>And exactly when I asked you do you have an iPad or because it saves you coming in I could do it through but you haven't.</v>

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.070
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, come through says actually</v>

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:58.470
<v Charlie Green>that hopefully on Monday they tell me on Monday I should have it.</v>

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:00.550
<v Charlie Green>So from then like should get easier.</v>

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.070
<v Charlie Green>But thank you so much for the face to face.</v>

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:05.450
<v Jane Smythe>I'm gonna see you again hopefully.</v>

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:06.390
<v Charlie Green>Let's hope you get</v>

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.690
<v Jane Smythe>some guidance on your inheritance tax</v>

01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:10.140
<v Charlie Green>and that's all I need.</v>

01:45:10.150 --> 01:45:10.470
<v Charlie Green>Then</v>

01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:11.970
<v Jane Smythe>then then that way we can plan it.</v>

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Jane Smythe>So obviously like I said if it's not then we can postpone it.</v>

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.880
<v Jane Smythe>It's not a problem because they're either you took</v>

01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:23.770
<v Charlie Green>that advice I don't wanna mess you around or your time completely on it but I think it looks as if it we're going.</v>

01:45:24.810 --> 01:45:25.680
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, definitely.</v>

01:45:25.690 --> 01:45:26.820
<v Jane Smythe>I'm glad you've definitely</v>

01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:28.400
<v Charlie Green>got an idea that risk.</v>

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.430
<v Jane Smythe>But I'd like to believe it.</v>
